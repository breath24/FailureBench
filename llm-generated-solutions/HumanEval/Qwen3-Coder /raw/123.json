  "task_description": "\ndef get_odd_collatz(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Given a positive integer n, return a sorted list that has the odd numbers in collatz sequence.\n\n    The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics that concerns a sequence defined\n    as follows: start with any positive integer n. Then each term is obtained from the \n    previous term as follows: if the previous term is even, the next term is one half of \n    the previous term. If the previous term is odd, the next term is 3 times the previous\n    term plus 1. The conjecture is that no matter what value of n, the sequence will always reach 1.\n\n    Note: \n        1. Collatz(1) is [1].\n        2. returned list sorted in increasing order.\n\n    For example:\n    get_odd_collatz(5) returns [1, 5] # The collatz sequence for 5 is [5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1], so the odd numbers are only 1, and 5.\n    \"\"\"\n",
