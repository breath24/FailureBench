  "task_description": "You are given a string S consisting of six types of characters: (, ), [, ], <, >.\nA string T is called a colorful bracket sequence if it satisfies the following condition:\n\nIt is possible to turn T into an empty string by repeating the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):\n\n- If there exists a contiguous substring of T that is one of (), [], or <>, choose one such substring and delete it.\n- If the deleted substring was at the beginning or end of T, the remainder becomes the new T.\n- Otherwise, concatenate the part before the deleted substring and the part after the deleted substring, and that becomes the new T.\n\n\nDetermine whether S is a colorful bracket sequence.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS\n\nOutput\n\nIf S is a colorful bracket sequence, print Yes; otherwise, print No.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- S is a string of length between 1 and 2\\times 10^5, inclusive.\n- S consists of (, ), [, ], <, >.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n([])<>()\n\nSample Output 1\n\nYes\n\nFor S=([])<>(), it is possible to turn it into an empty string by repeating the operation as follows:\n\n- Delete the substring [] from the 2nd to the 3rd character in ([])<>(), then concatenate the parts before and after it. The string becomes ()<>().\n- Delete the substring () from the 1st to the 2nd character in ()<>(). The string becomes <>().\n- Delete the substring <> from the 1st to the 2nd character in <>(). The string becomes ().\n- Delete the substring () from the 1st to the 2nd character in (). The string becomes empty.\n\nThus, S=([])<>() is a colorful bracket sequence, so print Yes.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n([<)]>\n\nSample Output 2\n\nNo\n\nSince S=([<)]> does not contain (), [], or <> as a contiguous substring, we cannot perform the 1st operation, and in particular S is not a colorful bracket sequence. Therefore, print No.\n\nSample Input 3\n\n())\n\nSample Output 3\n\nNo\n\nIt is impossible to turn S into an empty string by repeating the operations.\nTherefore, S is not a colorful bracket sequence, so print No.",
