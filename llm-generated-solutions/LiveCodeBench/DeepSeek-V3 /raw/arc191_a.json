  "task_description": "You are given a string S of length N and a string T of length M, both consisting of digits from 1 to 9.\nYou will perform the following operation for k=1,2,\\ldots,M in order:\n\n- Choose an integer i such that 1 \\le i \\le N. Then, replace the i-th character of S with the k-th character of T.\n\nFind the maximum possible value of the resulting string S interpreted as an integer after performing the M operations.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M\nS\nT\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the maximum possible value of the resulting string S interpreted as an integer after performing the M operations.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1 \\le N,M \\le 10^6\n- N and M are integers.\n- S is a string of length N consisting of digits from 1 through 9.\n- T is a string of length M consisting of digits from 1 through 9.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 3\n191\n325\n\nSample Output 1\n\n593\n\nThe following sequence of operations is optimal:\n\n- For k=1: Choose i=3. Then, S = 193.\n- For k=2: Choose i=1. Then, S = 293.\n- For k=3: Choose i=1. Then, S = 593.\n\nIn this case, the value of S interpreted as an integer is 593, which is the maximum.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3 9\n191\n998244353\n\nSample Output 2\n\n993\n\nSample Input 3\n\n11 13\n31415926535\n2718281828459\n\nSample Output 3\n\n98888976555",
