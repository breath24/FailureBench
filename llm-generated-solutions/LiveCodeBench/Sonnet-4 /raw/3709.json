  "task_description": "You are given a string s and an integer k.\nDetermine if there exists a substring of length exactly k in s that satisfies the following conditions:\n\nThe substring consists of only one distinct character (e.g., \"aaa\" or \"bbb\").\nIf there is a character immediately before the substring, it must be different from the character in the substring.\nIf there is a character immediately after the substring, it must also be different from the character in the substring.\n\nReturn true if such a substring exists. Otherwise, return false.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"aaabaaa\", k = 3\nOutput: true\nExplanation:\nThe substring s[4..6] == \"aaa\" satisfies the conditions.\n\nIt has a length of 3.\nAll characters are the same.\nThe character before \"aaa\" is 'b', which is different from 'a'.\nThere is no character after \"aaa\".\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"abc\", k = 2\nOutput: false\nExplanation:\nThere is no substring of length 2 that consists of one distinct character and satisfies the conditions.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= k <= s.length <= 100\ns consists of lowercase English letters only.",
