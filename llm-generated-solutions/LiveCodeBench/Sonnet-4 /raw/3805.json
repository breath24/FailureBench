  "task_description": "You are given a binary string s of length n, where:\n\n'1' represents an active section.\n'0' represents an inactive section.\n\nYou can perform at most one trade to maximize the number of active sections in s. In a trade, you:\n\nConvert a contiguous block of '1's that is surrounded by '0's to all '0's.\nAfterward, convert a contiguous block of '0's that is surrounded by '1's to all '1's.\n\nReturn the maximum number of active sections in s after making the optimal trade.\nNote: Treat s as if it is augmented with a '1' at both ends, forming t = '1' + s + '1'. The augmented '1's do not contribute to the final count.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"01\"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\nBecause there is no block of '1's surrounded by '0's, no valid trade is possible. The maximum number of active sections is 1.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"0100\"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\n\nString \"0100\" → Augmented to \"101001\".\nChoose \"0100\", convert \"101001\" → \"100001\" → \"111111\".\nThe final string without augmentation is \"1111\". The maximum number of active sections is 4.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"1000100\"\nOutput: 7\nExplanation:\n\nString \"1000100\" → Augmented to \"110001001\".\nChoose \"000100\", convert \"110001001\" → \"110000001\" → \"111111111\".\nThe final string without augmentation is \"1111111\". The maximum number of active sections is 7.\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: s = \"01010\"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\n\nString \"01010\" → Augmented to \"1010101\".\nChoose \"010\", convert \"1010101\" → \"1000101\" → \"1111101\".\nThe final string without augmentation is \"11110\". The maximum number of active sections is 4.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n == s.length <= 10^5\ns[i] is either '0' or '1'",
