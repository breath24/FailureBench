  "task_description": "You are given a 2D integer array properties having dimensions n x m and an integer k.\nDefine a function intersect(a, b) that returns the number of distinct integers common to both arrays a and b.\nConstruct an undirected graph where each index i corresponds to properties[i]. There is an edge between node i and node j if and only if intersect(properties[i], properties[j]) >= k, where i and j are in the range [0, n - 1] and i != j.\nReturn the number of connected components in the resulting graph.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: properties = [[1,2],[1,1],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[7,7]], k = 1\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nThe graph formed has 3 connected components:\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: properties = [[1,2,3],[2,3,4],[4,3,5]], k = 2\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\nThe graph formed has 1 connected component:\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: properties = [[1,1],[1,1]], k = 2\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\nintersect(properties[0], properties[1]) = 1, which is less than k. This means there is no edge between properties[0] and properties[1] in the graph.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n == properties.length <= 100\n1 <= m == properties[i].length <= 100\n1 <= properties[i][j] <= 100\n1 <= k <= m",
