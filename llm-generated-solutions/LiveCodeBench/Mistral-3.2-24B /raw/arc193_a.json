That is, [l, r] = \\lbrace l, l+1, l+2, \\ldots, r-1, r\\rbrace.\nYou are given N pairs of integers (L_1, R_1), (L_2, R_2), \\ldots, (L_N, R_N).\nBased on these pairs, consider an undirected graph G defined as follows:\n\n- It has N vertices numbered 1, 2, \\ldots, N.\n- For all i, j \\in [1, N], there is an undirected edge between vertices i and j if and only if the intersection of [L_i, R_i] and [L_j, R_j] is empty.\n\nIn addition, for each i = 1, 2, \\ldots, N, define the weight of vertex i to be W_i.\nYou are given Q queries about G. Process these queries in the order they are given.\nFor each i = 1, 2, \\ldots, Q, the i-th query is the following:\n\nYou are given integers s_i and t_i (both between 1 and N, inclusive) such that s_i \\neq t_i. Determine whether there exists a path from vertex s_i to vertex t_i in G. If it exists, print the minimum possible weight of such a path.\n\nHere, the weight of a path from vertex s to vertex t is defined as the sum of the weights of the vertices on that path (including both endpoints s and t).\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nW_1 W_2 \\cdots W_N\nL_1 R_1\nL_2 R_2\n\\vdots\nL_N R_N\nQ\ns_1 t_1\ns_2 t_2\n\\vdots\ns_Q t_Q\n\nOutput\n\nPrint Q lines.\nFor each i = 1, 2, \\ldots, Q, on the i-th line, if there exists a path from vertex s_i to vertex t_i, print the minimum possible weight of such a path, and print -1 otherwise.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 2 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n- 1 \\leq Q \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n- 1 \\leq W_i \\leq 10^9\n- 1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq 2N\n- 1 \\leq s_i, t_i \\leq N\n- s_i \\neq t_i\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\n5 1 4 2 2\n2 4\n1 2\n7 8\n4 5\n2 7\n3\n1 4\n4 3\n5 2\n\nSample Output 1\n\n11\n6\n-1\n\nG is a graph with four undirected edges: \\lbrace 1, 3\\rbrace, \\lbrace 2, 3\\rbrace, \\lbrace 2, 4\\rbrace, \\lbrace 3, 4\\rbrace.\n\n- For the first query, there is a path from vertex 1 to vertex 4 given by 1 \\to 3 \\to 4. The weight of this path is W_1 + W_3 + W_4 = 5 + 4 + 2 = 11, and this is the minimum possible.\n- For the second query, there is a path from vertex 4 to vertex 3 given by 4 \\to 3. The weight of this path is W_4 + W_3 = 2 + 4 = 6, and this is the minimum possible.\n- For the third query, there is no path from vertex 5 to vertex 2. Hence, print -1.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n8\n44 75 49 4 78 79 12 32\n5 13\n10 16\n6 8\n6 15\n12 15\n5 7\n1 15\n1 2\n5\n5 6\n3 2\n7 5\n4 5\n5 4\n\nSample Output 2\n\n157\n124\n-1\n114\n114",
