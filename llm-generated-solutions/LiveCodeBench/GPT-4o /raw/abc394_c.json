  "task_description": "You are given a string S consisting of uppercase English letters.\nApply the following procedure to S, and then output the resulting string:\n\nAs long as the string contains WA as a (contiguous) substring, repeat the following operation:\n\n- Among all occurrences of WA in the string, replace the leftmost one with AC.\n\n\nIt can be proved under the constraints of this problem that this operation is repeated at most a finite number of times.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the resulting string after performing the procedure described in the problem statement on S.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- S is a string of uppercase English letters with length between 1 and 3\\times 10^5, inclusive.\n\nSample Input 1\n\nWACWA\n\nSample Output 1\n\nACCAC\n\nInitially, the string is S= WACWA.\nThis string contains WA as a substring in two places: from the 1st to the 2nd character, and from the 4th to the 5th character.\nIn the first operation, we replace the leftmost occurrence (the substring from the 1st to the 2nd character) with AC, resulting in ACCWA.\nAfter the first operation, the string contains WA as a substring in exactly one place: from the 4th to the 5th character.\nIn the second operation, we replace it with AC, resulting in ACCAC.\nSince ACCAC does not contain WA as a substring, the procedure ends. Therefore, we output ACCAC.\n\nSample Input 2\n\nWWA\n\nSample Output 2\n\nACC\n\nInitially, the string is S= WWA.\nThis string contains WA as a substring in exactly one place: from the 2nd to the 3rd character.\nIn the first operation, we replace it with AC, resulting in WAC.\nThen, after the first operation, the string contains WA in exactly one place: from the 1st to the 2nd character.\nIn the second operation, we replace it with AC, resulting in ACC.\nSince ACC does not contain WA as a substring, the procedure ends. Therefore, we output ACC.\n\nSample Input 3\n\nWWWWW\n\nSample Output 3\n\nWWWWW\n\nSince S does not contain WA as a substring from the start, no operations are performed and the procedure ends immediately. Therefore, we output WWWWW.",
