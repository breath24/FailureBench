  "task_description": "Takahashi measured his body temperature and found it to be X {}^\\circC.\nBody temperature is classified into the following:\n\n- Higher than or equal to 38.0 {}^\\circC: “High fever”\n- Higher than or equal to 37.5 {}^\\circC and lower than 38.0 {}^\\circC: “Fever”\n- Lower than 37.5 {}^\\circC: “Normal”\n\nWhich classification does Takahashi's body temperature fall into? Present the answer as an integer according to the Output section.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nX\n\nOutput\n\nPrint an integer specified below corresponding to Takahashi's body temperature classification.\n\n- High fever: 1\n- Fever: 2\n- Normal: 3\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 30 \\leq X \\leq 50\n- X is given to one decimal place.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n40.0\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1\r\n\nHis body temperature is 40.0 {}^\\circC, which is classified as a high fever. Thus, print 1.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n37.7\n\nSample Output 2\n\n2\r\n\nHis body temperature is 37.7 {}^\\circC, which is classified as a fever. Thus, print 2.\n\nSample Input 3\n\n36.6\n\nSample Output 3\n\n3\r\n\nHis body temperature is 36.6 {}^\\circC, which is classified as a normal temperature. Thus, print 3.",
