  "task_description": "A string is defined to be a valid parenthesis sequence if and only if it satisfies one of the following conditions:\n\n- It is an empty string.\n- There exists a valid parenthesis sequence A such that the string is obtained by concatenating (, A, and ) in this order.\n- There exist non-empty valid parenthesis sequences A and B such that the string is obtained by concatenating A and B in this order.\n\nYou are given a valid parenthesis sequence S of length N. You can perform the following operation any number of times:\n\n- Choose a contiguous substring of S that is a valid parenthesis sequence, and reverse it.\n\nHere, reversing the substring of S from the l-th character to the r-th character means the following:\n\n- For every integer i satisfying l \\leq i \\leq r, simultaneously replace S_i with ) if S_{l+r-i} is (, and with ( if S_{l+r-i} is ).(Note that reversing here is different from the usual definition of reversing.)\n\nFind the number, modulo 998244353, of distinct strings S that you can have at the end of the process.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\r\nS\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the answer.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1 \\leq N \\leq 5000\n- |S| = N\n- S is a valid parenthesis sequence.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n6\r\n(())()\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\r\n\nFor example, you can transform S into ()(()) by doing the following:\n\n- Choose the substring from the 1st to the 6th character of S. This is a valid parenthesis sequence. S becomes ()(()).\n\nThe only other string that can be formed is (())(). Thus, the answer is 2.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n2\r\n()\n\nSample Output 2\n\n1",
