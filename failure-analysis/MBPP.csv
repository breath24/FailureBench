MBPP/398,"This task is about computing the sum of digits for each number in a given list. All models failed because they simplified the task to handling only flat lists of positive integers. This assumption caused systematic errors on the provided tests, which included negatives, nested lists, and non-numeric elements, leading to crashes when parsing characters like '-' or '[' or when applying numeric operations to unsupported types. The failures illustrate a recurring LLM pattern: defaulting to the simplest interpretation of a task while overlooking edge cases implied by the input space."
MBPP/430,"This task is about writing a function that calculates the directrix line of a parabola from its standard equation parameters. The models generated different and often inconsistent formulas, many of which did not match the mathematically correct definition of a parabola’s directrix. However, the benchmark’s canonical solution is itself based on an incorrect formula, producing outputs that are definitively wrong. This creates a situation where, regardless of variation in the models’ reasoning, no model without prior exposure to the benchmark’s flawed ground truth could succeed on the task."
