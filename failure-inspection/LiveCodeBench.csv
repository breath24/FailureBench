3674,"The task is to count how many subarrays can be made non-decreasing if, for each subarray independently, you may increase elements by at most k total increments. All models failed by miscalculating the cost of making a subarray non-decreasing. They treated it as the sum of local drops, ignoring that increments propagate forward, requiring elements to be raised to the running maximum. This represents a clear case of algorithmic misunderstanding.",Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm
3687,"The task is to find the longest ancestor-to-descendant path whose node values are all distinct (maximizing total edge length), and among all such longest paths, report the minimum number of nodes on one. Models mapped the problem to familiar tree tasks (e.g., diameter) instead of respecting the ancestor–descendant restriction with uniqueness. They either merged branches or mishandled duplicates, failing to use the required sliding-window approach. This reflects misgeneralization to the wrong problem class.",Wrong Problem Mapping
3736,"The task is to find the first adjacent unequal digit pair where each digit’s total frequency in the string equals its numeric value, returning that pair or """" if none. Here, the algorithms were correct, but all models failed the output specification. The prompt required returning results as string literals (e.g., ""23""), but models returned unquoted digits. This shows a weakness in attention to I/O details, particularly when the required output format is uncommon.",Formatting Mistakes
3763,"This task asks you to find the lowest horizontal line that splits a set of axis-aligned squares into two equal-area parts. The benchmark shows two distinct error modes: some models (DeepSeek, LLaMA) essentially implemented the right binary search on the cumulative area function but returned the wrong bound due to rounding and boundary bias, giving answers like 0.9999999 instead of the expected 1.0. Others (GPT-4o, Mistral, Qwen, Sonnet) mis-modeled the geometry by treating square contributions as discrete area jumps at event heights rather than as piecewise-linear slopes, or by anchoring their interpolation to the wrong values, leading to incorrect results such as 2.0 or 0. Overall, the failures highlight two common weaknesses: difficulty with numerical precision/formatting in problems requiring continuous search, and a tendency to oversimplify geometric accumulation into step functions, which misses the true linear growth of area between events.","Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm, Formatting Mistakes"
3794,"The task asks for the minimum total time to brew a sequence of potions, each of which must pass through all wizards in order without waiting between them. In this benchmark instance, the problem is a no-wait flow shop, but most models solved it as a buffered flow shop where potions can wait between wizards. This explains why several outputs (e.g., 58, 88) were consistently lower than the expected 110: allowing waiting reduces makespan but violates the prompt's constraint. DeepSeek diverged further, treating the setup like parallel independent machines, which gave the implausibly small output (8). These responses show a tendency to map novel scheduling problems onto familiar templates (e.g., standard flow shop DP) instead of internalizing the crucial no-wait detail. Overall, the errors reveal two weaknesses: (1) pattern over-generalization leading to structurally wrong solutions, and (2) a bias toward producing smaller, seemingly plausible outputs that fit the easier but incorrect variant of the problem.",Wrong Problem Mapping
3805,"The task asks us to maximize the number of active sections (1's) in a binary string by performing at most one trade: delete a 1-block between 0’s, then flip the merged 0-block into 1’s. The benchmark reveals that most models failed because they did not fully capture the two-step causal effect of the operation. DeepSeek assumed a trade is always possible and overcounted, producing outputs larger than allowed. GPT-4o and Sonnet considered flipping zero-blocks but ignored how deleting a 1-block merges its neighboring zeros, leading to undercounts. Qwen came closest but still dropped the contribution of the deleted 1-block inside the merged zero-block. LLaMA and Mistral misunderstood the operation entirely, modeling it as arbitrary segment toggling or block counting, producing structurally wrong answers. The uniform error pattern shows models tended to simplify the task into familiar string-edit operations and overlooked the unusual merge effect at the heart of the rule, causing systematically smaller or otherwise incorrect outputs.","Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm, Wrong Problem Mapping"
abc387_f,"The task asks us to count how many ways we can assign values from 1 to M to N nodes of a graph, where each node’s value must not exceed the value of the node it points to. This forms functional graphs with cycles and in-trees, where all cycle nodes must share one value. In this benchmark, most models failed because they either misclassified the graph as a DAG (GPT-4o, Mistral, Sonnet) or used a standard DP template that cannot enforce cycle equality (DeepSeek, GPT-4o). Others (Qwen, LLaMA) recognized cycles but either abandoned the computation or attempted infeasible bitmask approaches. This led to systematically wrong outputs like 0, 4, or 10 instead of the correct 6. The errors reveal a common weakness: models tend to map unfamiliar functional-graph constraints onto easier, familiar structures (like DAGs or prefix DPs), while failing to internalize the crucial cycle condition that all cycle nodes must share one value.","Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm, Wrong Problem Mapping"
abc388_g,"This task asks, for each query on a sorted list of mochi sizes, to find the maximum number of disjoint pairs where the smaller is at most half the size of the larger. The benchmark shows that most models misinterpreted this as either counting all valid pairs (GPT-4o) or using a wrong greedy strategy that failed to ensure disjointness (DeepSeek, Qwen3, Sonnet, Mistral). LLaMA compounded this with I/O handling issues while also relying on a nonstandard greedy. The recurring error pattern is that models tended to solve a superficially similar but easier variant—like counting feasible pairs or making the earliest/largest possible match—rather than the true maximum matching problem. This highlights a weakness in correctly internalizing the matching/disjointness requirement, leading to systematic under- or over-counting in their outputs.",Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm
abc389_e,"This task asks: given N product types where buying k units of type i costs k^2 times P_i, and a budget M, find the maximum total units purchasable. A well-known approach is to observe that each additional unit has a marginal cost of (2k+1) times P_i, so an effective strategy is to always purchase the globally cheapest next unit, which can be implemented with a heap. In this benchmark, however, the models consistently failed because they misrepresented the cost structure: some treated the problem as if each product had to be bought in equal blocks, ignoring price differences; others attempted greedy or heap-based methods but miscomputed costs, either by mixing total and marginal costs or by summing block costs instead of per-unit increments. The result was systematic under- or over-counting of units, for example outputs of 0, 1, 2, or 5 instead of the correct 3, revealing a shared weakness: difficulty in properly handling convex, marginal-cost optimization, even when the heap-based greedy pattern was partially recognized.","Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm, Wrong Problem Mapping"
abc389_g,"This task asks: for even N, count connected labeled graphs with M edges where BFS from vertex 1 yields equal numbers of vertices at even and odd distances, modulo a prime P. The benchmark reveals that most models struggled heavily: DeepSeek tried to reduce the condition to balanced bipartite partitions but ignored connectivity and intra-part edges, leading to severe undercounting, for example outputting 12 3 0 0 instead of 12 9 3 0. Mistral misinterpreted the graph space by iterating over vertex masks rather than edge subsets, producing only zeros. Qwen3 built scaffolding for modular arithmetic but never implemented the actual counting, defaulting to zero for larger cases. GPT-4o, LLaMA, and Sonnet failed even earlier by not returning a usable function at all. The consistent theme is that the models either oversimplified the structural condition to something much weaker, namely bipartite partitioning, or failed to handle the inherent combinatorial complexity of counting connected graphs with layered BFS parity constraints.",Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm
abc390_d,"This task asks you to take N bags of stones, repeatedly merge them until a final partition is reached, and count the distinct possible XORs of the bag totals. The benchmark shows that models consistently misunderstood the structure of the problem: DeepSeek and LLaMA treated it as a linear-basis subset XOR problem, ignoring that group sums with carries are involved rather than raw XORs of the original numbers, leading to overcounts. GPT-4o drifted further by computing distinct subset sums, a different quantity altogether. Mistral attempted heuristic adjustments around the total XOR and undercounted. Qwen and Sonnet tried to enumerate partitions but only explored restricted families of them, like hub-and-spoke or forced dumping into one bag, so they missed many valid outcomes and returned much smaller counts. Overall, the models' failures reflect two main weaknesses: mis-modeling the combinatorial structure as a simpler subset-XOR problem, or attempting enumeration but pruning the space too aggressively to be correct.","Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm, Wrong Problem Mapping"
abc390_f,"This benchmark task asks us to compute, for every subarray of a sequence, the minimum number of operations needed to erase it, where each operation removes all numbers from a fully contained consecutive interval. The final answer is the sum of these values over all subarrays. The correct solution relies on recognizing that each subarray's answer is simply the number of blocks of consecutive distinct values it contains. However, the tested models diverged from this principle in different ways: some, like DeepSeek and GPT-4o, misapplied interval DP or stack-based logic, effectively counting structural properties unrelated to value gaps; others, like Mistral, Sonnet, and Qwen3, mistakenly treated the operation as removing the range between the minimum and maximum, ignoring missing integers; and Llama3.3 failed due to a fragile simulation approach. As a result, nearly all models produced incorrect totals, either under- or over-counting, revealing a common weakness in carefully capturing the exact legality of the operation rather than approximating it with looser heuristics.","Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm, Wrong Problem Mapping"
abc390_g,"This benchmark asks us to sum, modulo 998244353, the integers formed by concatenating all numbers in each permutation of 1 through N. The challenge is that each number has a different digit length, so its contribution depends on how many and which numbers appear to its right, creating a non-uniform shifting effect. Most models failed because they reused the simpler fixed-digit permutation sum formula, which assumes every element has equal width, and therefore ignored the varying positional shifts. DeepSeek and GPT-4o both applied factorial–power-of-10 style formulas that under- or over-counted contributions, while Mistral and Sonnet tried to handle digit lengths but used flawed approximations or arithmetic, and Qwen3 gave an elegant but fundamentally misapplied closed form. Llama did not return a function at all. These results highlight a systematic weakness: the tendency of models to force complex combinatorial problems into overly familiar templates instead of fully reasoning through the variable-length structure required by the task.","Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm, Wrong Problem Mapping"
abc391_g,"This benchmark task asks: given a string S of length N and an integer M, count how many length-M strings over the alphabet have longest common subsequence with S equal to k for each k = 0..N. A natural solution approach is to encode LCS states as bitmasks and perform dynamic programming with precomputed transitions, which allows exact counting. In this instance, most models failed because they replaced the subtle automaton-based reasoning with oversimplified strategies: some, such as GPT-4o and Sonnet, treated the problem as if character matches were independent and ignored subsequence order; others, such as DeepSeek and Mistral, tried to adapt a standard DP table to enumeration and ended up double-counting or miscounting states; and still others, such as Llama and Qwen, attempted brute force or incomplete DP formulations that either crashed or diverged. The result was a wide spread of incorrect outputs, often under- or overcounting certain LCS lengths, highlighting that these models struggled to capture the correct combinatorial structure and instead defaulted to familiar but invalid templates.","Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm, Wrong Problem Mapping"
abc392_d,"This benchmark task asks us to compute, given several dice with possibly repeated faces, the maximum probability that two optimally chosen dice will roll the same number. In other words, we must compare every pair of dice, calculate the probability of their rolls matching while accounting for duplicates, and output the highest value with strict precision formatting. The analysis of model behavior shows that most models, including DeepSeek, GPT-4o, Llama, Qwen, and Sonnet, correctly derived the probability formula, but their outputs failed due to formatting mismatches—for instance, printing too many or too few decimals compared to the required fixed 15-digit format. Mistral was the exception, making a deeper logical error by counting only one match per shared face instead of the full product of occurrences, underestimating the probability. This benchmark highlights how models often succeed on the core math but stumble on exact input and output requirements, and in some cases, misinterpret the independence of dice faces, leading to structural mistakes.","Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm, Formatting Mistakes"
abc395_f,"This benchmark instance comes from a problem where Takahashi has N upper and N lower teeth, and he can grind them down so that each upper–lower pair sums to the same height H, with consecutive uppers differing by at most X. The task is to compute the minimum grinding cost. A natural solution separates the problem cleanly: for each candidate H, the cost is simply the total reduction, given by sum(U_i + D_i) minus N times H, and feasibility is checked using interval propagation to ensure the upper teeth can be assigned consistently. By contrast, the models generally failed to disentangle cost from feasibility. DeepSeek and GPT-4o tried to optimize each tooth’s adjustment individually, miscounting cost and sometimes searching for the wrong H. Llama-3.3 assumed sums must already be equal, missing the allowed grinding. Mistral and Sonnet incorrectly applied all reductions to upper teeth, making valid cases look impossible, while Qwen resorted to brute force, leading to timeouts. These behaviors highlight a recurring weakness: the models misunderstood the decomposition of the problem into a simple linear cost function and a feasibility check, conflating optimization and constraint satisfaction.",Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm
abc398_f,"Given a string S, append the fewest characters to its end so the result is a palindrome that keeps S as a prefix. DeepSeek, GPT-4o, and Llama 3.3 70B all flipped the required overlap (they matched prefix(S) with suffix(reverse(S))) and thus over-appended, producing “ABCCB” for “ABC” instead of “ABCBA.” Mistral Small 3.2 24B chased the longest palindromic prefix of S and appended from the reverse, yielding “ABCA,” which isn’t a palindrome—showing a conceptual mismatch from the suffix/prefix overlap the task needs. Qwen3 used KMP but built the concatenation in the wrong order, computing the wrong overlap and returning the longer “TREEERT” instead of “TREERT.” Sonnet 4 appended reversed prefixes and accepted the first palindrome found rather than the shortest, also outputting “TREEERT.” Notably, several models seem swayed by the prompt’s “any of them is accepted” wording, overlooking that it still requires the shortest palindrome, and multiple models consistently misread the direction of the overlap.","Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm, Wrong Problem Mapping"
abc398_g,"The task is a two-player game on an undirected graph that initially contains no odd cycles; players alternately add new edges provided no odd cycle is created, and the winner is determined by the parity of the maximum number of legal edge additions (total bipartite edges possible minus existing edges). DeepSeek, GPT-4o, and Sonnet 4 all tried to count moves but subtracted or aggregated incorrectly, either double-counting, ignoring cross-component edges, or using ad-hoc parity formulas, which led to wrong winners on sample 3. Llama 3.3 70B misinterpreted the problem as completing general graphs with DSU and even crashed on input. Mistral Small 3.2 24B reduced the game to mere connectivity, failing immediately on sample 1. Qwen3 invented parity heuristics over bipartite component sizes and added a special case for M = 0, causing errors. Many models seemed to mistrust or re-check the “graph has no odd cycle” condition already guaranteed by the prompt, and several defaulted to simplistic parity or connectivity templates instead of tackling the true optimization over bipartitions and isolated vertices that the problem demands.","Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm, Wrong Problem Mapping"
abc399_d,"The task is to count pairs of couples in a seating arrangement such that neither couple starts adjacent, and by swapping one member of each couple, both can end up adjacent. DeepSeek, GPT-4o, Mistral, and Qwen3 all fell into the same trap: they reduced the problem to checking whether two couples’ intervals “cross” in the array, which greatly overcounts valid cases (e.g. producing 10 instead of 4), since crossing does not guarantee adjacency after swaps. Llama3.3 70B went further, actually simulating swaps with crude neighbor checks, which undercounted due to index mishandling and logic errors. Sonnet4 tried to brute-force all index assignments but scrambled the role of endpoints, demanding overly strict conditions and thus undercounting (giving all zeros). Many models seemed to misinterpret the swap rule, treating it either as “interval crossing” or as “direct adjacency after a single swap,” instead of the precise condition in the prompt; this shows a tendency to oversimplify the operation semantics into a familiar but incorrect structure.","Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm, Wrong Problem Mapping"
abc399_e,"The task is to decide if string S can be transformed into string T using any number of global “replace all x with y” operations, and if possible, compute the minimum number of such operations; otherwise output -1. DeepSeek crashed on input parsing and, even if it ran, its logic would wrongly reject solvable cycles. GPT-4o and Mistral both enforced a strict one-to-one bijection between S and T characters, so they returned -1 on valid many-to-one mappings. Llama3.3 similarly treated any cycle as impossible, failing on cases like sample 1. Qwen3 tried a graph plus topological sort approach, but it also banned cycles and undercounted operations, producing too few. Sonnet4 used union-find, which missed detecting true conflicts and so output a positive number instead of -1 for impossible cases. Several models misinterpreted the prompt’s replacement operation, assuming cycles are unresolvable or that mappings must be bijections, rather than recognizing that cycles can be handled with a temporary letter and that many-to-one mappings are valid.","Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm, Wrong Problem Mapping"
arc190_d,"The task is to take an N × N matrix A with entries modulo a prime p, replace every zero entry by values from 1 to p−1, compute B^p for every such matrix B, sum all these matrices, and output the result modulo p. Across the models, most failed because they treated the problem as if each matrix entry could be handled independently (e.g. raising elements to the p-th power and scaling by counts), ignoring that matrix powers couple entries through multiplication. Deepseek and GPT-4o both used per-entry formulas, leading to wrong results (GPT-4o also crashed with a list.strip error). Mistral had the same IO error and additionally masked Python’s built-in pow with math.pow, breaking modular exponentiation. Qwen did implement matrix multiplication but enumerated zero replacements incorrectly (handling one zero at a time instead of all combinations), producing mismatched sums. Llama 3.3 and Sonnet 4 failed to return a function at all. Several models, despite the prompt explicitly requiring full matrix powers, defaulted to simplifying the task into elementwise exponentiation—suggesting a systematic misinterpretation of “B^p” as entrywise rather than matrix power.","Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm, Wrong Problem Mapping"
arc191_a,"The task is to maximize the final integer value of a digit string S after sequentially applying M replacement operations, where each step replaces one chosen digit of S with the next digit from string T. Across models, most failed because they used overly local greedy strategies rather than planning replacements with respect to positional significance. Deepseek and GPT-4o both applied greedy heuristics (heap-based or left-to-right replacement) and ended with suboptimal results. Llama3.3 crashed with an index error due to mixing stdin handling and flawed indexing logic. Mistral mistakenly targeted the smallest digits to overwrite, destroying higher-order value and yielding poor outputs. Qwen3 and Sonnet4 both implemented a “replace first improvable digit else last digit” rule, which came close but was still off by one in the sample due to suboptimal tie-breaking. Several models misread the need for global optimality over all operations and instead defaulted to simplistic step-by-step greedies, while some also violated the prompt’s expected function interface (e.g., adding stdin code).",Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm
arc191_c,"The task is for each input N, output any pair (A,M) (both ≤ 10^18) such that the multiplicative order of A modulo M is exactly N (smallest n with A^n ≡ 1 mod M). Most models failed by emitting formulaic pairs without ensuring the order condition or the test’s exact expected pair: deepseek prints A = N+1, M = N^2+N (special-casing N = 1), gpt-4o uses A = N+1, M = N; mistral, qwen3, and sonnet4 mostly default to (2, 2^N−1) (with minor N = 1 variations), never verifying minimality; llama3.3 also targets A = 2 with ad-hoc divisions of 2^N−1, coincidentally matching N = 3 but failing others. Although the problem states any valid (A,M) is acceptable, the benchmark checks against a single fixed output per case (e.g., expects 20250126 1 for N = 1), so even potentially valid alternative pairs are graded as mismatches, and several models additionally ignored the “smallest n” requirement altogether.",Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm
arc192_b,"Given N and positive A1…An, players alternately decrement any Ai; the first time an index is used it’s added to S, and the mover who makes S = {1..N} wins—so the winner depends only on the parity of extra moves, i.e., (sum Ai − N) mod 2 (odd → Fennec, even → Snuke). Most failing models latched onto the wrong invariant: GPT-4o, Qwen3, and Sonnet4 used parity of sum Ai (ignoring the N mandatory first-touch moves) and thus flipped Sample 1; Llama3.3 treated it like Nim/XOR, a category error; Mistral tried to simulate moves (infeasible for large sum Ai) and even mixed up “player” vs “pile index,” effectively touching only piles 1 and 2, causing a timeout; DeepSeek invented ad-hoc logic around min(A) and second minima—irrelevant to the true condition—so it mispredicted Sample 2. Several models fixated on familiar impartial-game heuristics (sum parity or XOR) and overlooked the sentence “the game ends when every index has been touched,” which implies exactly N first-touch moves and makes sum Ai − N the decisive quantity; Sonnet even tried to account for first touches but canceled them out because Ai ≥ 1, landing back at the wrong rule.","Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm, Wrong Problem Mapping"

Most LLM attempts failed because they either produced syntax errors (deepseek inserted stray text, qwen wrote long editorial-like notes breaking indentation, sonnet omitted the function entirely) or logic errors (gpt-4o, llama3, mistral misused p or q directly as sequence elements, ignored integrality via denominators/LCM, or checked gcd on the wrong objects). Several responses oversimplified the math, assuming independent contributions from factors, and never actually built integer sequences reduced by gcd as required. The failures reflect how the prompt’s subtle requirements—coprime factorization, sequence reconstruction with scaling, and gcd normalization—tripped up models, leading them to either collapse into incomplete commentary code, invent alternative combinatorial processes, or compute the wrong quantities despite correct modulo handling.","Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm, Formatting Mistakes"

Sonnet4 tried to enumerate start/end pairs with ad-hoc blocking checks but missed edge cases on the closed rectangle boundaries, causing slight under/over-counting (187). Llama3 70B failed at I/O (top-level stdin read) causing a parsing error.

Most failing models misunderstood the “at least one” requirement and wrongly enforced equal counts of 1s (so they output -1 on the first sample where |A|1 ≠ |B|1 but is achievable by stacking), or they reduced the operation to pairwise matching (max or sum of |a_i − b_i|) that ignores the global, synchronous motion. Others used wrong proxies: boundary-only checks that even produced negative steps, a prefix-difference flow model suited for independent adjacent moves (not global pulls), or an infeasible brute-force/heuristic search with arbitrary cutoffs. There were also implementation issues: a model re-read stdin outside the required function causing a parsing crash, and one model’s code contained contradictory logic (early equality check short-circuiting later, more sensible matching).

LLaMA also crashed due to unguarded I/O (print(candidate_func(sys.stdin.read())), causing an input parsing error independent of logic. In short, most failures stem from misunderstanding the core constraint (exactly one push or pop per step, pops only from the end) and replacing it with unrelated patterns (subarray/subsequence/heuristics), plus one tooling/I/O mistake; where outputs differ from the sample (e.g. 10, 13, 9, −2), they reflect those invalid models of the process rather than edge-case ambiguity.","Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm, Wrong Problem Mapping"

arc196_b,"Given H×W toroidal grids filled with A (adjacent-edge “L”) and B (opposite-edge straight) tiles; each tile can be rotated (A: 4 ways, B: 2 ways), and we must count rotations so every shared edge is consistent (either both tiles touch it or neither), modulo 998244353. Most failing models ignored this local edge-matching rule and replaced it with unjustified global parity/dimension heuristics: some demanded H or W be even, or that counts of A/B be even, or just returned 2^b or 4^a 2^b as if tiles were independent (deepseek, gpt-4o, mistral, qwen). One (llama) also broke input handling by reading stdin at top level, causing a parsing error; its fallback logic likewise relied on parity shortcuts. The only attempt that structured a proper backtracking check (sonnet) mis-encoded tile orientations, swapping A/B edge patterns and even using single-edge “dead-end” patterns for A, so its search space excluded valid configurations and yielded zeros. In short, failures stem from ignoring or mis-implementing the edge-consistency constraint on a torus, inventing parity rules, I/O mistakes, and incorrect orientation modeling.",Wrong Problem Mapping
arc196_d,"The task asks for each query over a subset of people moving along a line of towns, decide whether you can assign integer strengths to roads so each selected person’s full-path sum is 0 and every proper prefix sum along their path is strictly positive. The failures stem from either hard errors or wrong reductions: deepseek crashes with a syntax error (garbled parsing, undefined vars), gpt-4o wrongly reduces feasibility to graph bipartiteness, ignoring the equality/strict-positivity constraints, llama3.3 mixes function-plus-stdin script I/O (breaking the harness) and, even if fixed, seems to check interval patterns instead of the stated sums, mistral imposes a global alternating/parity rule on edges which isn’t required and yields wrong decisions, qwen3 gets a type/signature mismatch (list vs. str) and its sweep/segment-tree logic ignores that queries select subsets of people, and sonnet4 overconstrains edges to a single ±1 “direction,” missing that arbitrary integer magnitudes per edge may satisfy all paths. Most mistakes came from oversimplifying the feasibility check into parity or bipartite-like rules instead of handling the true system of equalities plus strict inequalities. Others arose from not restricting constraints to the queried subset, misusing I/O in the harness, or treating edge strengths as fixed ±1 rather than arbitrary integers.","Flawed/Incomplete Algorithm, Formatting Mistakes"
