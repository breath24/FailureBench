However, what people don't know is Tribonacci sequence.\n    Tribonacci sequence is defined by the recurrence:\n    tri(1) = 3\n    tri(n) = 1 + n / 2, if n is even.\n    tri(n) =  tri(n - 1) + tri(n - 2) + tri(n + 1), if n is odd.\n    For example:\n    tri(2) = 1 + (2 / 2) = 2\n    tri(4) = 3\n    tri(3) = tri(2) + tri(1) + tri(4)\n           = 2 + 3 + 3 = 8 \n    You are given a non-negative integer number n, you have to a return a list of the \n    first n + 1 numbers of the Tribonacci sequence.\n    Examples:\n    tri(3) = [1, 3, 2, 8]\n    \"\"\"\n"
