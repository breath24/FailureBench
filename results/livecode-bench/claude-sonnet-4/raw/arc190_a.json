  "task_description": "There is an integer sequence x = (x_1, \\ldots, x_N), which is initialized with x_1 = \\cdots = x_N = 0.\nYou will perform M operations on this integer sequence. In the i-th operation, you are given an integer pair (L_i, R_i) such that 1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq N, and you must perform exactly one of the following three operations:\n\n- Operation 0: Do nothing. This operation incurs a cost of 0.\n- Operation 1: For each integer j with 1 \\leq j \\leq N, if L_i \\leq j \\leq R_i holds, set x_j = 1. This operation incurs a cost of 1.\n- Operation 2: For each integer j with 1 \\leq j \\leq N, if L_i \\leq j \\leq R_i does not hold, set x_j = 1. This operation incurs a cost of 1.\n\nYour goal is to make x_1 = \\cdots = x_N = 1 hold at the end. Determine whether this goal can be achieved. If it can be achieved, present one way to achieve it where the total cost of the operations is minimized.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M\nL_1 R_1\n\\vdots\nL_M R_M\n\nOutput\n\nIf the goal is not achievable, print -1.\nIf the goal is achievable, print one way to achieve it where the total cost of the operations is minimized, in the following format, where K is the minimum total cost of the operations, and \\mathrm{op}_i is the type of operation (0, 1, or 2) chosen for the i-th operation.\nK\n\\mathrm{op}_1 \\cdots \\mathrm{op}_M\n\nIf there are multiple ways that minimize the total cost, printing any one of them is accepted.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1 \\leq N \\leq 1000000\n- 1 \\leq M \\leq 200000\n- 1 \\leq L_i \\leq R_i \\leq N\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5 4\n2 4\n3 5\n1 4\n2 5\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\n2 0 1 0\n\nIn the sample output, x changes as follows:\n\n- Initially, x = (0,0,0,0,0).\n- In the 1st operation, Operation 2 is performed. x_1 and x_5 become 1, so x = (1,0,0,0,1).\n- In the 2nd operation, Operation 0 is performed. x remains (1,0,0,0,1).\n- In the 3rd operation, Operation 1 is performed. x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4 become 1, so x = (1,1,1,1,1).\n- In the 4th operation, Operation 0 is performed. x remains (1,1,1,1,1).\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5 4\n1 3\n1 5\n2 4\n3 5\n\nSample Output 2\n\n1\n0 1 0 0\n\nSample Input 3\n\n5 2\n1 3\n2 5\n\nSample Output 3\n\n2\n1 1\n\nSample Input 4\n\n5 2\n1 3\n2 4\n\nSample Output 4\n\n-1"
