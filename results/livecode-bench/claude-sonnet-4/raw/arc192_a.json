  "task_description": "You are given a positive integer N and a sequence A=(A_1,A_2,\\dots,A_N) of length N, consisting of 0 and 1.\nWe call a string S of length N, consisting only of uppercase English letters, a good string if it is possible to perform the following operation any number of times (possibly zero) so that the sequence A contains no 0. Here, S_i (1\\leq i\\leq N) denotes the i-th character of S, and we define S_{N+1}=S_1, S_{N+2}=S_2, and A_{N+1}=A_1.\n\n- Perform one of the following operations:\n- Choose an integer i with 1\\leq i\\leq N such that S_i= A, S_{i+1}= R, and S_{i+2}= C, and replace each of A_i and A_{i+1} with 1.\n- Choose an integer i with 1\\leq i\\leq N such that S_{i+2}= A, S_{i+1}= R, and S_i= C, and replace each of A_i and A_{i+1} with 1.\n\n\n\nDetermine whether there exists a good string.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nA_1 A_2 \\dots A_N\n\nOutput\n\nIf there exists a good string, print Yes; otherwise, print No.\nThe judge is case-insensitive; for example, if the correct answer is Yes, outputs such as yes, YES, or yEs will also be accepted.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 3\\leq N\\leq 200000\n- A_i\\in \\lbrace 0,1 \\rbrace (1\\leq i\\leq N)\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n12\n0 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0\n\nSample Output 1\n\nYes\n\nFor example, RARCARCCRAGC is a good string. This is because it is possible to change all elements of A to 1 by performing the following operations:\n\n- Initially, A=(0,1,0,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0).\n- Perform the first operation with i=2. Then, A=(0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0).\n- Perform the first operation with i=5. Then, A=(0,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,1,1,1,0).\n- Perform the second operation with i=8. Then, A=(0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0).\n- Perform the second operation with i=12. Then, A=(1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1).\n\nSince there exists a good string, output Yes.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3\n0 0 0\n\nSample Output 2\n\nNo\n\nGood strings do not exist.\n\nSample Input 3\n\n29\n1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\nSample Output 3\n\nYes\n\nSince A already contains no 0, every string of length 29 consisting of uppercase English letters is a good string."
