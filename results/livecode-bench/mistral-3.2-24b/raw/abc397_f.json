  "task_description": "This problem is a harder version of Problem C. Here, the sequence is split into three subarrays.\n\nYou are given an integer sequence of length N: A = (A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N).\nWhen splitting A at two positions into three non-empty (contiguous) subarrays, find the maximum possible sum of the counts of distinct integers in those subarrays.\nMore formally, find the maximum sum of the following three values for a pair of integers (i,j) such that 1 \\leq i < j \\leq N-1: the count of distinct integers in (A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_i), the count of distinct integers in (A_{i+1},A_{i+2},\\ldots,A_j), and the count of distinct integers in (A_{j+1},A_{j+2},\\ldots,A_{N}).\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nA_1 A_2 \\ldots A_N\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the answer.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 3 \\leq N \\leq 3 \\times 10^5\n- 1 \\leq A_i \\leq N (1 \\leq i \\leq N)\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n5\n3 1 4 1 5\n\nSample Output 1\n\n5\n\nIf we let (i,j) = (2,4) to split the sequence into three subarrays (3,1), (4,1), (5), the counts of distinct integers in those subarrays are 2, 2, 1, respectively, for a total of 5. This sum cannot be greater than 5, so the answer is 5. Other partitions, such as (i,j) = (1,3), (2,3), (3,4), also achieve this sum.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n10\n2 5 6 4 4 1 1 3 1 4\n\nSample Output 2\n\n9"
