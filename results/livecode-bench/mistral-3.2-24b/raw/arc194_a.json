  "task_description": "You are given an integer sequence of length N: (A_1, A_2, \\ldots, A_N). There is also a sequence S, which is initially empty.\nFor each i = 1, 2, \\ldots, N in this order, you perform exactly one of the following two operations:\n\n- Append A_i as an element to the end of S.\n- Delete the last element of S. You cannot choose this operation if S is empty.\n\nPrint the maximum possible value of the sum of the elements of S after all operations.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\r\nA_1 A_2 \\ldots A_N\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the answer.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n- -10^9 \\leq A_i \\leq 10^9\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n6\r\n3 -1 -4 5 -9 2\n\nSample Output 1\n\n8\r\n\nStarting from the initial state where S is an empty sequence, consider the following operations:\n\n- For i = 1, append A_1 = 3 to the end of S. Now, S = (3).\n- For i = 2, append A_2 = -1 to the end of S. Now, S = (3, -1).\n- For i = 3, delete the last element of S. Now, S = (3).\n- For i = 4, append A_4 = 5 to the end of S. Now, S = (3, 5).\n- For i = 5, append A_5 = -9 to the end of S. Now, S = (3, 5, -9).\n- For i = 6, delete the last element of S. Now, S = (3, 5).\n\nHere, the sum of the elements of S after all operations is 3 + 5 = 8, which is the maximum possible value.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n1\r\n-1\n\nSample Output 2\n\n-1\r\n\nNote that if S is empty, you must choose to append an element.\n\nSample Input 3\n\n20\r\n-14 74 -48 38 -51 43 5 37 -39 -29 80 -44 -55 59 17 89 -37 -68 38 -16\n\nSample Output 3\n\n369"
