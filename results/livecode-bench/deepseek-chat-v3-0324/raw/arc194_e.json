  "task_description": "You are given two strings S and T, each of length N and consisting of 0 and 1, as well as two positive integers X and Y. For i = 1, 2, \\ldots, N, let S_i denote the i-th character of S.\nDetermine whether it is possible to make S identical to T by repeatedly performing Operations A and B below any number of times (possibly zero) in any order:\n\n- \r\n(Operation A) Choose an integer i satisfying 1 \\leq i \\leq N-(X+Y)+1, S_{i} = S_{i+1} = \\cdots = S_{i+X-1} = 0, and S_{i+X} = S_{i+X+1} = \\cdots = S_{i+X+Y-1} = 1, then change each of S_{i}, S_{i+1}, \\ldots, S_{i+Y-1} to 1 and each of S_{i+Y}, S_{i+Y+1}, \\ldots, S_{i+Y+X-1} to 0.\n\n- \r\n(Operation B) Choose an integer i satisfying 1 \\leq i \\leq N-(X+Y)+1, S_{i} = S_{i+1} = \\cdots = S_{i+Y-1} = 1, and S_{i+Y} = S_{i+Y+1} = \\cdots = S_{i+Y+X-1} = 0, then change each of S_{i}, S_{i+1}, \\ldots, S_{i+X-1} to 0 and each of S_{i+X}, S_{i+X+1}, \\ldots, S_{i+X+Y-1} to 1.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN X Y\r\nS\r\nT\n\nOutput\n\nIf it is possible to make S identical to T, print Yes; otherwise, print No.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1 \\leq N \\leq 5 \\times 10^5\n- 1 \\leq X, Y \\leq N\n- S and T are strings of length N consisting of 0 and 1.\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n9 2 1\r\n000111001\r\n011000011\n\nSample Output 1\n\nYes\r\n\nThe following procedure can transform S into T:\n\n- First, perform Operation A with i = 2.
