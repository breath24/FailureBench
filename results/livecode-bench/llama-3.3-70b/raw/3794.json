  "task_description": "You are given two integer arrays, skill and mana, of length n and m, respectively.\nIn a laboratory, n wizards must brew m potions in order. Each potion has a mana capacity mana[j] and must pass through all the wizards sequentially to be brewed properly. The time taken by the i^th wizard on the j^th potion is time_ij = skill[i] * mana[j].\nSince the brewing process is delicate, a potion must be passed to the next wizard immediately after the current wizard completes their work. This means the timing must be synchronized so that each wizard begins working on a potion exactly when it arrives. \u200b\nReturn the minimum amount of time required for the potions to be brewed properly.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: skill = [1,5,2,4], mana = [5,1,4,2]\nOutput: 110\nExplanation:\n\n\n\nPotion Number\nStart time\nWizard 0 done by\nWizard 1 done by\nWizard 2 done by\nWizard 3 done by\n\n\n0\n0\n5\n30\n40\n60\n\n\n1\n52\n53\n58\n60\n64\n\n\n2\n54\n58\n78\n86\n102\n\n\n3\n86\n88\n98\n102\n110\n\n\n\nAs an example for why wizard 0 cannot start working on the 1^st potion before time t = 52, consider the case where the wizards started preparing the 1^st potion at time t = 50. At time t = 58, wizard 2 is done with the 1^st potion, but wizard 3 will still be working on the 0^th potion till time t = 60.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: skill = [1,1,1], mana = [1,1,1]\nOutput: 5\nExplanation:\n\nPreparation of the 0^th potion begins at time t = 0, and is completed by time t = 3.\nPreparation of the 1^st potion begins at time t = 1, and is completed by time t = 4.\nPreparation of the 2^nd potion begins at time t = 2, and is completed by time t = 5.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: skill = [1,2,3,4], mana = [1,2]\nOutput: 21\n\n \nConstraints:\n\nn == skill.length\nm == mana.length\n1 <= n, m <= 5000\n1 <= mana[i], skill[i] <= 5000"
