  "task_description": "You are given a positive integer N and two strings S and T, each of length N and consisting of lowercase English letters.\nDetermine whether it is possible to make S identical to T by repeating the operation below any number of times (possibly zero). If it is possible, also find the minimum number of operations required.\n\n- Choose two lowercase English letters x, y and replace every occurrence of x in S with y.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\r\nS\r\nT\n\nOutput\n\nIf it is possible to make S identical to T, print the minimum number of operations required. Otherwise, print -1.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1\\leq N \\leq 2\\times 10^5\n- N is an integer.\n- Each of S and T is a string of length N, consisting of lowercase English letters.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n6\r\nafbfda\r\nbkckbb\n\nSample Output 1\n\n4\r\n\nBy performing the operation four times in the following way, you can make S identical to T:\n\n- Choose x= b and y= c. S becomes afcfda.\n- Choose x= a and y= b. S becomes bfcfdb.\n- Choose x= f and y= k. S becomes bkckdb.\n- Choose x= d and y= b. S becomes bkckbb, which is identical to T.\n\nIt cannot be done with fewer than four operations, so the minimum number of operations required is 4.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n4\r\nabac\r\nabac\n\nSample Output 2\n\n0\r\n\nS and T are already identical, so no operations are required.\n\nSample Input 3\n\n4\r\nabac\r\nabrc\n\nSample Output 3\n\n-1\r\n\nNo matter how you repeat the operation, it is impossible to make S identical to T.\n\nSample Input 4\n\n4\r\nabac\r\nbcba\n\nSample Output 4\n\n4"
