  "task_description": "You are given an integer numberOfUsers representing the total number of users and an array events of size n x 3.\nEach events[i] can be either of the following two types:\n\nMessage Event: [\"MESSAGE\", \"timestamp_i\", \"mentions_string_i\"]\n\nThis event indicates that a set of users was mentioned in a message at timestamp_i.\nThe mentions_string_i string can contain one of the following tokens:\n\t\t\nid<number>: where <number> is an integer in range [0,numberOfUsers - 1]. There can be multiple ids separated by a single whitespace and may contain duplicates. This can mention even the offline users.\nALL: mentions all users.\nHERE: mentions all online users.\n\n\n\n\nOffline Event: [\"OFFLINE\", \"timestamp_i\", \"id_i\"]\n\nThis event indicates that the user id_i had become offline at timestamp_i for 60 time units. The user will automatically be online again at time timestamp_i + 60.\n\n\n\nReturn an array mentions where mentions[i] represents the number of mentions the user with id i has across all MESSAGE events.\nAll users are initially online, and if a user goes offline or comes back online, their status change is processed before handling any message event that occurs at the same timestamp.\nNote that a user can be mentioned multiple times in a single message event, and each mention should be counted separately.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: numberOfUsers = 2, events = [[\"MESSAGE\",\"10\",\"id1 id0\"],[\"OFFLINE\",\"11\",\"0\"],[\"MESSAGE\",\"71\",\"HERE\"]]\nOutput: [2,2]\nExplanation:\nInitially, all users are online.\nAt timestamp 10, id1 and id0 are mentioned. mentions = [1,1]\nAt timestamp 11, id0 goes offline.\nAt timestamp 71, id0 comes back online and \"HERE\" is mentioned. mentions = [2,2]\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: numberOfUsers = 2, events = [[\"MESSAGE\",\"10\",\"id1 id0\"],[\"OFFLINE\",\"11\",\"0\"],[\"MESSAGE\",\"12\",\"ALL\"]]\nOutput: [2,2]\nExplanation:\nInitially, all users are online.\nAt timestamp 10, id1 and id0 are mentioned. mentions = [1,1]\nAt timestamp 11, id0 goes offline.\nAt timestamp 12, \"ALL\" is mentioned. This includes offline users, so both id0 and id1 are mentioned. mentions = [2,2]\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: numberOfUsers = 2, events = [[\"OFFLINE\",\"10\",\"0\"],[\"MESSAGE\",\"12\",\"HERE\"]]\nOutput: [0,1]\nExplanation:\nInitially, all users are online.\nAt timestamp 10, id0 goes offline.\nAt timestamp 12, \"HERE\" is mentioned. Because id0 is still offline, they will not be mentioned. mentions = [0,1]\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= numberOfUsers <= 100\n1 <= events.length <= 100\nevents[i].length == 3\nevents[i][0] will be one of MESSAGE or OFFLINE.\n1 <= int(events[i][1]) <= 10^5\nThe number of id<number> mentions in any \"MESSAGE\" event is between 1 and 100.\n0 <= <number> <= numberOfUsers - 1\nIt is guaranteed that the user id referenced in the OFFLINE event is online at the time the event occurs."
