But sample says 3 operations.\n        # Did I misunderstand the problem?\n        # \"there is at least one piece in square i if and only if B_i = 1\"\n        # This means final configuration must have pieces exactly where B has 1s.\n        # And initially pieces are where A has 1s.\n        # But A has 4 ones, B has 3 ones. How can we end up with 3 pieces from 4?\n        # Ah, maybe multiple pieces can occupy the same square.\n        # The problem says \"move all pieces simultaneously\".\n        # So multiple pieces can be in the same square.\n        # And the final condition is: square i has at least one piece iff B[i] = 1.\n        # So we need at least as many pieces as there are 1s in B.\n        # But we can have more, as long as the \"at least one\" condition is met.\n        # No, that's not right either. Let me read again.\n        # \"For every i ..., there is at least one piece in square i if and only if B_i = 1.\"\n        # This is a bi-conditional. So:\n        # - If B_i = 1, then there must be at least one piece in square i.\n        # - If B_i = 0, then there must be zero pieces in square i.\n        # So the final configuration must have exactly one piece in each square i where B_i = 1,\n        # and zero pieces in each square i where B_i = 0.\n        # Therefore, the number of pieces must be equal to the number of 1s in B.\n        # But in first example, A has 4 ones, B has 3 ones. So impossible.\n        # But sample output is 3, not -1.\n        # Let me check the sample again.\n        # A = 01001101 (0-based) -> pieces at positions [1,4,5,7]\n        # B = 00001011 (0-based) -> need pieces at positions [4,6,7]\n        # We have 4 pieces, need exactly pieces at positions 4,6,7.\n        # But we can't just \"need pieces at positions\", we need exactly one piece at each of those positions and none elsewhere.\n        # With 4 pieces and needing exactly 3 positions to have pieces, it's impossible.\n        # The problem must allow multiple pieces per square and the condition is about \"at least one\".\n        # Let me re-read...\n        # \"there is at least one piece in square i if and only if B_i = 1\"\n        # Yes, it's \"at least one\". So multiple pieces can be in the same square.\n        # And the constraint is:\n        # - For every i with B_i = 1, there must be at least one piece in square i.\n        # - For every i with B_i = 0, there must be zero pieces in square i.\n        # So in the end:\n        # - Squares with B_i = 0 must be empty.\n        # - Squares with B_i = 1 must have at least one piece.\n        # The total number of pieces we have is the number of 1s in A.\n        # This must be at least the number of 1s in B.\n        # It can be more, and excess pieces can be placed in squares where B_i = 1.\n        \n        # So in first example:\n        # A = 01001101 -> pieces at [1,4,5,7] (0-based)\n        # B = 00001011 -> target squares [4,6,7]\n        # We have 4 pieces, need at least 1 piece each in squares 4,6,7.\n        # This is possible.\n        \n        # How to solve:\n        # We have pieces at positions in pieces_A.\n        # We need to place them such that:\n        # - No pieces in squares where B_i = 0.\n        # - At least one piece in each square where B_i = 1.\n        \n        # This is a matching problem. But since pieces can co-locate,\n        # we just need to ensure every target square gets at least one piece.\n        \n        # Strategy:\n        # 1. Check if number of pieces >= number of targets. If not, impossible.\n        # 2. To minimize operations, we want to assign pieces to targets optimally.\n        # 3. Since pieces maintain relative order, we can't assign a piece from left\n        #    to a target on the right if there's a piece in between that needs to go\n        #    to a target on the left. The assignment must respect the order.\n        \n        # The optimal assignment is to sort both lists and pair them in order.\n        # Then, the minimum number of operations is the maximum distance\n        # any piece needs to travel to its assigned target.\n        \n        # But we have more pieces than targets. So we need to choose which pieces\n        # to use and where to assign them.\n        \n        # Actually, let's re-think. The problem says \"there is at least one piece\".\n        # So we need to move pieces around such that:\n        # - Squares with B_i = 0 are empty.\n        # - Squares with B_i = 1 have at least one piece.\n        \n        # In terms of the final configuration, we don't care where extra pieces go,\n        # as long as they are in squares where B_i = 1.\n        \n        # To minimize operations, we should move pieces optimally.\n        # The key insight is that we can choose any index in each operation\n        # and move all pieces one step closer.\n        \n        # One approach:\n        # 1. Identify target squares (where B_i = 1).\n        # 2. Assign enough pieces to these targets.\n        # 3. Calculate minimum operations needed.\n        \n        # Since pieces maintain order, we can use a greedy assignment.\n        # Sort target positions.\n        # For each target, assign the nearest available piece that respects order.\n        \n        # But there's a simpler way given the nature of the operations.\n        # The minimum number of operations is the maximum over all necessary\n        # movements. But what movements are necessary?\n        \n        # Let's think of it as a transportation problem where we want to\n        # move pieces to satisfy the density requirement of B.\n        \n        # There's a known algorithm for this type of problem.\n        # The minimum number of operations is computed by considering\n        # the \"excess\" and \"deficit\" positions and calculating the cost\n        # of moving the \"flow\" of pieces.\n        \n        # But given the multiple-choice nature and the examples,\n        # the formula is likely: \n        # Sort pieces and targets, pair them optimally respecting order,\n        # and the cost is max distance.\n        \n        # However, with excess pieces, we need to choose which pieces to move.\n        \n        # Simpler approach for implementation:\n        # 1.
