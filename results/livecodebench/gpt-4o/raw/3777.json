  "task_description": "You are given an integer array nums and two integers, k and limit. Your task is to find a non-empty subsequence of nums that:\n\nHas an alternating sum equal to k.\nMaximizes the product of all its numbers without the product exceeding limit.\n\nReturn the product of the numbers in such a subsequence. If no subsequence satisfies the requirements, return -1.\nThe alternating sum of a 0-indexed array is defined as the sum of the elements at even indices minus the sum of the elements at odd indices.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3], k = 2, limit = 10\nOutput: 6\nExplanation:\nThe subsequences with an alternating sum of 2 are:\n\n[1, 2, 3]\n\nAlternating Sum: 1 - 2 + 3 = 2\nProduct: 1 * 2 * 3 = 6\n\n\n[2]\n\nAlternating Sum: 2\nProduct: 2\n\n\n\nThe maximum product within the limit is 6.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [0,2,3], k = -5, limit = 12\nOutput: -1\nExplanation:\nA subsequence with an alternating sum of exactly -5 does not exist.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [2,2,3,3], k = 0, limit = 9\nOutput: 9\nExplanation:\nThe subsequences with an alternating sum of 0 are:\n\n[2, 2]\n\nAlternating Sum: 2 - 2 = 0\nProduct: 2 * 2 = 4\n\n\n[3, 3]\n\nAlternating Sum: 3 - 3 = 0\nProduct: 3 * 3 = 9\n\n\n[2, 2, 3, 3]\n\nAlternating Sum: 2 - 2 + 3 - 3 = 0\nProduct: 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 = 36\n\n\n\nThe subsequence [2, 2, 3, 3] has the greatest product with an alternating sum equal to k, but 36 > 9. The next greatest product is 9, which is within the limit.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 150\n0 <= nums[i] <= 12\n-10^5 <= k <= 10^5\n1 <= limit <= 5000"
