  "task_description": "You are given an integer array nums and two integers, x and k. You can perform the following operation any number of times (including zero):\n\nIncrease or decrease any element of nums by 1.\n\nReturn the minimum number of operations needed to have at least k non-overlapping subarrays of size exactly x in nums, where all elements within each subarray are equal.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [5,-2,1,3,7,3,6,4,-1], x = 3, k = 2\nOutput: 8\nExplanation:\n\nUse 3 operations to add 3 to nums[1] and use 2 operations to subtract 2 from nums[3]. The resulting array is [5, 1, 1, 1, 7, 3, 6, 4, -1].\nUse 1 operation to add 1 to nums[5] and use 2 operations to subtract 2 from nums[6]. The resulting array is [5, 1, 1, 1, 7, 4, 4, 4, -1].\nNow, all elements within each subarray [1, 1, 1] (from indices 1 to 3) and [4, 4, 4] (from indices 5 to 7) are equal. Since 8 total operations were used, 8 is the output.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [9,-2,-2,-2,1,5], x = 2, k = 2\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\n\nUse 3 operations to subtract 3 from nums[4]. The resulting array is [9, -2, -2, -2, -2, 5].\nNow, all elements within each subarray [-2, -2] (from indices 1 to 2) and [-2, -2] (from indices 3 to 4) are equal. Since 3 operations were used, 3 is the output.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n2 <= nums.length <= 10^5\n-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6\n2 <= x <= nums.length\n1 <= k <= 15\n2 <= k * x <= nums.length"
