  "task_description": "You are given an integer array groups, where groups[i] represents the size of the i^th group. You are also given an integer array elements.\nYour task is to assign one element to each group based on the following rules:\n\nAn element at index j can be assigned to a group i if groups[i] is divisible by elements[j].\nIf there are multiple elements that can be assigned, assign the element with the smallest index j.\nIf no element satisfies the condition for a group, assign -1 to that group.\n\nReturn an integer array assigned, where assigned[i] is the index of the element chosen for group i, or -1 if no suitable element exists.\nNote: An element may be assigned to more than one group.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: groups = [8,4,3,2,4], elements = [4,2]\nOutput: [0,0,-1,1,0]\nExplanation:\n\nelements[0] = 4 is assigned to groups 0, 1, and 4.\nelements[1] = 2 is assigned to group 3.\nGroup 2 cannot be assigned any element.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: groups = [2,3,5,7], elements = [5,3,3]\nOutput: [-1,1,0,-1]\nExplanation:\n\nelements[1] = 3 is assigned to group 1.\nelements[0] = 5 is assigned to group 2.\nGroups 0 and 3 cannot be assigned any element.\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: groups = [10,21,30,41], elements = [2,1]\nOutput: [0,1,0,1]\nExplanation:\nelements[0] = 2 is assigned to the groups with even values, and elements[1] = 1 is assigned to the groups with odd values.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= groups.length <= 10^5\n1 <= elements.length <= 10^5\n1 <= groups[i] <= 10^5\n1 <= elements[i] <= 10^5"
