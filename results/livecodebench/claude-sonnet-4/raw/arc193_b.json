  "task_description": "You are given a positive integer N and a length-N string s_0s_1\\ldots s_{N-1} consisting only of 0 and 1.\nConsider a simple undirected graph G with (N+1) vertices numbered 0, 1, 2, \\ldots, N, and the following edges:\n\n- For each i = 0, 1, \\ldots, N-1, there is an undirected edge between vertices i and (i+1)\\bmod N.\n- For each i = 0, 1, \\ldots, N-1, there is an undirected edge between vertices i and N if and only if s_i =  1.\n- There are no other edges.\n\nFurthermore, create a directed graph G' by assigning a direction to each edge of G. That is, for each undirected edge \\lbrace u, v \\rbrace in G, replace it with either a directed edge (u, v) from u to v or a directed edge (v, u) from v to u.\nFor each i = 0, 1, \\ldots, N, let d_i be the in-degree of vertex i in G'. Print the number, modulo 998244353, of distinct sequences (d_0, d_1, \\ldots, d_N) that can be obtained.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\ns_0s_1\\ldots s_{N-1}\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the answer.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 3 \\leq N \\leq 10^6\n- N is an integer.\n- Each s_i is 0 or 1.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n010\n\nSample Output 1\n\n14\n\nG has four undirected edges: \\lbrace 0, 1 \\rbrace, \\lbrace 0, 2 \\rbrace, \\lbrace 1, 2 \\rbrace, \\lbrace 1, 3 \\rbrace.\nFor example, if we assign directions to each edge as 0 \\to 1, 2 \\to 0, 2 \\to 1, 1 \\to 3, then (d_0, d_1, d_2, d_3) = (1, 2, 0, 1) is obtained.\nThe possible sequences (d_0, d_1, d_2, d_3) are\n(0, 1, 2, 1), (0, 2, 1, 1), (0, 2, 2, 0), (0, 3, 1, 0), (1, 0, 2, 1), (1, 1, 1, 1), (1, 1, 2, 0), (1, 2, 0, 1), (1, 2, 1, 0), (1, 3, 0, 0), (2, 0, 1, 1), (2, 1, 0, 1), (2, 1, 1, 0), (2, 2, 0, 0), for a total of 14.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n20\n00001100111010100101\n\nSample Output 2\n\n261339902"
