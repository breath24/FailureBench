  "task_description": "You are given two length-N strings A = A_1A_2 \\ldots A_N and B = B_1B_2 \\ldots B_N, each consisting of 0 and 1.\nThere are N squares aligned in a row from left to right. For i = 1, 2, \\ldots, N, the i-th square from the left is called square i. Initially, square i contains a piece if A_i =  1, and no piece if A_i =  0.\nYou may repeat the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):\n\n- Choose an integer i between 1 and N, inclusive.\n- Move all pieces simultaneously one square closer to square i. That is, for each piece, let square j be its current position and square j' be its new position, and the following holds:\n- if i < j, then j' = j-1;\n- if i > j, then j' = j+1;\n- if i = j, then j' = j.\n\n\n\nDetermine whether it is possible to reach a configuration satisfying the following condition, and if it is possible, find the minimum number of operations needed to do so:\n\nFor every i = 1, 2, \\ldots, N, there is at least one piece in square i if and only if B_i =  1.\n\nYou are given T independent test cases. Print the answer for each of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nT\n\\mathrm{case}_1\n\\mathrm{case}_2\n\\vdots\n\\mathrm{case}_T\n\nHere, \\mathrm{case}_i (i=1,2,\\ldots,T) denotes the i-th test case.\nEach test case is given in the following format:\nN\nA\nB\n\nOutput\n\nPrint T lines.\nFor each i = 1, 2, \\ldots, T, on the i-th line, print -1 if it is impossible to reach a configuration satisfying the condition for the i-th test case. Otherwise, print the minimum number of operations needed.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1 \\leq T \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n- 1 \\leq N \\leq 10^6\n- T and N are integers.\n- A and B are strings of length N, each consisting of 0 and 1.\n- There exists i such that A_i =  1.\n- There exists i such that B_i =  1.\n- The sum of N over all test cases is at most 10^6.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n8\n01001101\n00001011\n3\n010\n111\n20\n10100011011110101011\n00010001111101100000\n\nSample Output 1\n\n3\n-1\n5\n\nThe input has three independent test cases.\nIn the first test case, initially, the sequence of the numbers of pieces in the squares is (0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1). By performing the operation three times as follows, you can satisfy the condition:\n\n- Choose i = 5. After the operation, the configuration is (0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1, 0).\n- Choose i = 8. After the operation, the configuration is (0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 1).\n- Choose i = 8. After the operation, the configuration is (0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 2, 1).\n\nIt is impossible to satisfy the condition in fewer than three operations, so the answer is 3.\nIn the second test case, no matter how you perform the operations, you cannot satisfy the condition, so the answer is -1."
