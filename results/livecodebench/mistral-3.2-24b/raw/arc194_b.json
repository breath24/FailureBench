Now, P = (2, 3, 1).\n- Pay a cost of 2 and swap P_2 = 3 and P_3 = 1. Now, P = (2, 1, 3).\n- Pay a cost of 1 and swap P_1 = 2 and P_2 = 1. Now, P = (1, 2, 3).\n\nThe total cost for these operations is 4, which is the minimum possible.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5\n2 4 1 3 5\n\nSample Output 2\n\n6\n\nSample Input 3\n\n2\n1 2\n\nSample Output 3\n\n0"
