  "task_description": "You are given two strings, s and t.\nYou can create a new string by selecting a substring from s (possibly empty) and a substring from t (possibly empty), then concatenating them in order.\nReturn the length of the longest palindrome that can be formed this way.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: s = \"a\", t = \"a\"\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\nConcatenating \"a\" from s and \"a\" from t results in \"aa\", which is a palindrome of length 2.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: s = \"abc\", t = \"def\"\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\nSince all characters are different, the longest palindrome is any single character, so the answer is 1.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: s = \"b\", t = \"aaaa\"\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\nSelecting \"aaaa\" from t is the longest palindrome, so the answer is 4.\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: s = \"abcde\", t = \"ecdba\"\nOutput: 5\nExplanation:\nConcatenating \"abc\" from s and \"ba\" from t results in \"abcba\", which is a palindrome of length 5.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= s.length, t.length <= 30\ns and t consist of lowercase English letters."
