  "task_description": "You are given an m x n 2D array grid of positive integers.\nYour task is to traverse grid in a zigzag pattern while skipping every alternate cell.\nZigzag pattern traversal is defined as following the below actions:\n\nStart at the top-left cell (0, 0).\nMove right within a row until the end of the row is reached.\nDrop down to the next row, then traverse left until the beginning of the row is reached.\nContinue alternating between right and left traversal until every row has been traversed.\n\nNote that you must skip every alternate cell during the traversal.\nReturn an array of integers result containing, in order, the value of the cells visited during the zigzag traversal with skips.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]]\nOutput: [1,4]\nExplanation:\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: grid = [[2,1],[2,1],[2,1]]\nOutput: [2,1,2]\nExplanation:\n\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]\nOutput: [1,3,5,7,9]\nExplanation:\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n2 <= n == grid.length <= 50\n2 <= m == grid[i].length <= 50\n1 <= grid[i][j] <= 2500"
