  "task_description": "N people labeled from 1 to N participated in a certain contest. The score of person i (1 \\leq i \\leq N) was P_i.\nIn this contest, the rank of each of the N people is determined by the following procedure:\n\n- Prepare a variable r, and initialize r = 1. Initially, the ranks of the N people are all undetermined.\n- Repeat the following operation until the ranks of all N people are determined:\n- Let x be the maximum score among the people whose ranks are currently undetermined, and let k be the number of people whose score is x. Determine the rank of those k people with score x to be r, and then add k to r.\n\n\n\nPrint the rank of each of the N people.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\r\nP_1 P_2 \\dots P_N\n\nOutput\n\nPrint N lines. The i-th line (1 \\leq i \\leq N) should contain the rank of person i as an integer.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1\\leq N \\leq 100\n- 1\\leq P_i \\leq 100\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4\r\n3 12 9 9\n\nSample Output 1\n\n4\r\n1\r\n2\r\n2\r\n\nThe ranks of the N\\ (=4) people are determined as follows:\n\n- Prepare a variable r and initialize r=1. At first, the ranks of all 4 people are undetermined.\n- Currently, persons 1, 2, 3, 4 have undetermined ranks. The maximum score among them is P_2\\ (=12). Therefore, determine the rank of person 2 to be r\\ (=1), and then add 1 to r, making r=2.\n- Currently, persons 1, 3, 4 have undetermined ranks. The maximum score among them is P_3=P_4\\ (=9). Therefore, determine the ranks of persons 3 and 4 to be r\\ (=2), and then add 2 to r, making r=4.\n- Currently, person 1 has an undetermined rank. The maximum score among them is P_1\\ (=3). Therefore, determine the rank of person 1 to be r\\ (=4), and then add 1 to r, making r=5.\n- The ranks of all 4 people are now determined, so the process ends.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3\r\n3 9 6\n\nSample Output 2\n\n3\r\n1\r\n2\n\nSample Input 3\n\n4\r\n100 100 100 100\n\nSample Output 3\n\n1\r\n1\r\n1\r\n1\n\nSample Input 4\n\n8\r\n87 87 87 88 41 38 41 38\n\nSample Output 4\n\n2\r\n2\r\n2\r\n1\r\n5\r\n7\r\n5\r\n7"
