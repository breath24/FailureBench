  "task_description": "You are given a permutation P = (P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_N) of (1, 2, \\ldots, N). Takahashi can repeatedly perform the following operation on P (possibly zero times):\n\n- Choose an integer i satisfying 1 \\leq i \\leq N-1. Pay a cost of i, and swap P_i and P_{i+1}.\n\nFind the minimum total cost required to sort P in ascending order.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\nP_1 P_2 \\ldots P_N\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the minimum total cost required to sort P in ascending order.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 2 \\leq N \\leq 2 \\times 10^5\n- (P_1, P_2, \\ldots, P_N) is a permutation of (1, 2, \\ldots, N).\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3\n3 2 1\n\nSample Output 1\n\n4\n\nTakahashi can sort P in ascending order as follows:\n\n- Pay a cost of 1 and swap P_1 = 3 and P_2 = 2. Now, P = (2, 3, 1).\n- Pay a cost of 2 and swap P_2 = 3 and P_3 = 1. Now, P = (2, 1, 3).\n- Pay a cost of 1 and swap P_1 = 2 and P_2 = 1. Now, P = (1, 2, 3).\n\nThe total cost for these operations is 4, which is the minimum possible.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5\n2 4 1 3 5\n\nSample Output 2\n\n6\n\nSample Input 3\n\n2\n1 2\n\nSample Output 3\n\n0"
