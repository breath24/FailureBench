  "task_description": "We have a directed graph with N vertices, numbered 1, 2, \\ldots, N.\nInformation about the edges is given by N^2 characters C_{1, 1}, C_{1, 2}, \\ldots, C_{1, N}, C_{2, 1}, \\ldots, C_{N, N}. Here, each C_{i, j} is either a lowercase English letter or -.\nIf C_{i, j} is a lowercase English letter, then there is exactly one directed edge from vertex i to vertex j labeled C_{i, j}. If C_{i, j} is -, there is no edge from vertex i to vertex j.\nFor each integer pair (i, j) with 1 \\leq i, j \\leq N, answer the following question:\n\n- Among all (not necessarily simple) paths from vertex i to vertex j whose concatenation of labels on the edges forms a palindrome, what is the length of the shortest such path? If there is no such path, the answer is -1.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\r\nC_{1, 1}C_{1, 2}\\ldotsC_{1, N}\r\nC_{2, 1}C_{2, 2}\\ldotsC_{2, N}\r\n\\vdots\r\nC_{N, 1}C_{N, 2}\\ldotsC_{N, N}\n\nOutput\n\nLet A_{i, j} be the answer to the question for the pair (i, j).
