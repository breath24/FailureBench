The i-th card (i=1,\\ldots,7) has an integer A_i written on it.\nDetermine whether it is possible to choose five of them so that the chosen cards form a full house.\nA set of five cards is called a full house if and only if the following conditions are satisfied:\n\n- For different integers x and y, there are three cards with x and two cards with y.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nA_1 A_2 A_3 A_4 A_5 A_6 A_7\n\nOutput\n\nIf a full house can be formed by choosing five cards, print Yes; otherwise, print No.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- A_i is an integer between 1 and 13, inclusive.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n1 4 1 4 2 1 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\nYes\n\nFor example, by choosing the cards (1,1,1,4,4), we can form a full house.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n11 12 13 10 13 12 11\n\nSample Output 2\n\nNo\n\nNo five cards chosen from the seven cards form a full house.\n\nSample Input 3\n\n7 7 7 7 7 7 7\n\nSample Output 3\n\nNo\n\nNote that five identical cards do not form a full house.\n\nSample Input 4\n\n13 13 1 1 7 4 13\n\nSample Output 4\n\nYes"
