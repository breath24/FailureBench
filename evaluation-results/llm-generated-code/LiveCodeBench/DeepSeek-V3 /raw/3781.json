  "task_description": "You are given an integer side, representing the edge length of a square with corners at (0, 0), (0, side), (side, 0), and (side, side) on a Cartesian plane.\nYou are also given a positive integer k and a 2D integer array points, where points[i] = [x_i, y_i] represents the coordinate of a point lying on the boundary of the square.\nYou need to select k elements among points such that the minimum Manhattan distance between any two points is maximized.\nReturn the maximum possible minimum Manhattan distance between the selected k points.\nThe Manhattan Distance between two cells (x_i, y_i) and (x_j, y_j) is |x_i - x_j| + |y_i - y_j|.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: side = 2, points = [[0,2],[2,0],[2,2],[0,0]], k = 4\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\n\nSelect all four points.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: side = 2, points = [[0,0],[1,2],[2,0],[2,2],[2,1]], k = 4\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\n\nSelect the points (0, 0), (2, 0), (2, 2), and (2, 1).\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: side = 2, points = [[0,0],[0,1],[0,2],[1,2],[2,0],[2,2],[2,1]], k = 5\nOutput: 1\nExplanation:\n\nSelect the points (0, 0), (0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 2), and (2, 2).\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= side <= 10^9\n4 <= points.length <= min(4 * side, 15 * 10^3)\npoints[i] == [xi, yi]\nThe input is generated such that:\n\t\npoints[i] lies on the boundary of the square.\nAll points[i] are unique.\n\n\n4 <= k <= min(25, points.length)",
