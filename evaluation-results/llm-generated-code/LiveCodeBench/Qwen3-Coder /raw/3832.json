  "task_description": "You are given an integer array cost of size n. You are currently at position n (at the end of the line) in a line of n + 1 people (numbered from 0 to n).\nYou wish to move forward in the line, but each person in front of you charges a specific amount to swap places. The cost to swap with person i is given by cost[i].\nYou are allowed to swap places with people as follows:\n\nIf they are in front of you, you must pay them cost[i] to swap with them.\nIf they are behind you, they can swap with you for free.\n\nReturn an array answer of size n, where answer[i] is the minimum total cost to reach each position i in the line.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: cost = [5,3,4,1,3,2]\nOutput: [5,3,3,1,1,1]\nExplanation:\nWe can get to each position in the following way:\n\ni = 0. We can swap with person 0 for a cost of 5.\ni = 1. We can swap with person 1 for a cost of 3.\ni = 2. We can swap with person 1 for a cost of 3, then swap with person 2 for free.\ni = 3. We can swap with person 3 for a cost of 1.\ni = 4. We can swap with person 3 for a cost of 1, then swap with person 4 for free.\ni = 5. We can swap with person 3 for a cost of 1, then swap with person 5 for free.\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: cost = [1,2,4,6,7]\nOutput: [1,1,1,1,1]\nExplanation:\nWe can swap with person 0 for a cost of 1, then we will be able to reach any position i for free.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n == cost.length <= 100\n1 <= cost[i] <= 100",
