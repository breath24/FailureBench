  "task_description": "You are given an integer array nums of length n and a 2D array queries, where queries[i] = [l_i, r_i, val_i].\nEach queries[i] represents the following action on nums:\n\nSelect a subset of indices in the range [l_i, r_i] from nums.\nDecrement the value at each selected index by exactly val_i.\n\nA Zero Array is an array with all its elements equal to 0.\nReturn the minimum possible non-negative value of k, such that after processing the first k queries in sequence, nums becomes a Zero Array. If no such k exists, return -1.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: nums = [2,0,2], queries = [[0,2,1],[0,2,1],[1,1,3]]\nOutput: 2\nExplanation:\n\nFor query 0 (l = 0, r = 2, val = 1):\n\nDecrement the values at indices [0, 2] by 1.\nThe array will become [1, 0, 1].\n\n\nFor query 1 (l = 0, r = 2, val = 1):\n\nDecrement the values at indices [0, 2] by 1.\nThe array will become [0, 0, 0], which is a Zero Array. Therefore, the minimum value of k is 2.\n\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: nums = [4,3,2,1], queries = [[1,3,2],[0,2,1]]\nOutput: -1\nExplanation:\nIt is impossible to make nums a Zero Array even after all the queries.\n\nExample 3:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,2,1], queries = [[0,1,1],[1,2,1],[2,3,2],[3,4,1],[4,4,1]]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\n\nFor query 0 (l = 0, r = 1, val = 1):\n\nDecrement the values at indices [0, 1] by 1.\nThe array will become [0, 1, 3, 2, 1].\n\n\nFor query 1 (l = 1, r = 2, val = 1):\n\nDecrement the values at indices [1, 2] by 1.\nThe array will become [0, 0, 2, 2, 1].\n\n\nFor query 2 (l = 2, r = 3, val = 2):\n\nDecrement the values at indices [2, 3] by 2.\nThe array will become [0, 0, 0, 0, 1].\n\n\nFor query 3 (l = 3, r = 4, val = 1):\n\nDecrement the value at index 4 by 1.\nThe array will become [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]. Therefore, the minimum value of k is 4.\n\n\n\n\nExample 4:\n\nInput: nums = [1,2,3,2,6], queries = [[0,1,1],[0,2,1],[1,4,2],[4,4,4],[3,4,1],[4,4,5]]\nOutput: 4\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= nums.length <= 10\n0 <= nums[i] <= 1000\n1 <= queries.length <= 1000\nqueries[i] = [l_i, r_i, val_i]\n0 <= l_i <= r_i < nums.length\n1 <= val_i <= 10",
