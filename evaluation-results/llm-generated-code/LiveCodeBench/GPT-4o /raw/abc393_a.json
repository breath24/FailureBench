  "task_description": "There are four types of oysters, labeled 1, 2, 3, and 4. Exactly one of these types causes stomach trouble if eaten. The other types do not cause stomach trouble when eaten.\nTakahashi ate oysters 1 and 2, and Aoki ate oysters 1 and 3. The information on whether each person got sick is given as two strings S_1 and S_2. Specifically, S_1 = sick means Takahashi got sick, and S_1 = fine means Takahashi did not get sick. Likewise, S_2 = sick means Aoki got sick, and S_2 = fine means Aoki did not get sick.\nBased on the given information, find which type of oyster causes stomach trouble.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS_1 S_2\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the label of the oyster that causes stomach trouble if eaten.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- Each of S_1 and S_2 is sick or fine.\n\nSample Input 1\n\nsick fine\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2\r\n\nTakahashi (who ate oysters 1 and 2) got sick, and Aoki (who ate oysters 1 and 3) did not get sick, so it can be concluded that oyster 2 causes stomach trouble.\n\nSample Input 2\n\nfine fine\n\nSample Output 2\n\n4\r\n\nNeither Takahashi (who ate oysters 1 and 2) nor Aoki (who ate oysters 1 and 3) got sick, so it can be concluded that oyster 4 causes stomach trouble.",
