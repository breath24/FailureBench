  "task_description": "Takahashi aggregated usage records from ticket gates.\r\nHowever, he accidentally erased some records of entering and exiting stations.\r\nHe is trying to restore the erased records.\n\nYou are given a string S consisting of i and o. We want to insert zero or more characters at arbitrary positions in S so that the resulting string satisfies the following conditions:\n\n- Its length is even, and every odd-numbered (1st, 3rd, ...) character is i while every even-numbered (2nd, 4th, ...) character is o.\n\nFind the minimum number of characters that need to be inserted. It can be proved under the constraints of this problem that by inserting an appropriate finite number of characters, S can be made to satisfy the conditions.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nS\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the answer.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- S is a string of length between 1 and 100, consisting of i and o.\n\nSample Input 1\n\nioi\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1\r\n\nWe can insert o after the 3rd character to form ioio to satisfy the conditions. The conditions cannot be satisfied by inserting zero or fewer characters.\n\nSample Input 2\n\niioo\n\nSample Output 2\n\n2\r\n\nWe can insert o after the 1st character and i after the 3rd character to satisfy the conditions. The conditions cannot be satisfied by inserting one or fewer characters.\n\nSample Input 3\n\nio\n\nSample Output 3\n\n0\r\n\nS already satisfies the conditions.",
