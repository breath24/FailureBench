  "task_description": "We have a directed graph with N vertices, numbered 1, 2, \\ldots, N.\nInformation about the edges is given by N^2 characters C_{1, 1}, C_{1, 2}, \\ldots, C_{1, N}, C_{2, 1}, \\ldots, C_{N, N}. Here, each C_{i, j} is either a lowercase English letter or -.\nIf C_{i, j} is a lowercase English letter, then there is exactly one directed edge from vertex i to vertex j labeled C_{i, j}. If C_{i, j} is -, there is no edge from vertex i to vertex j.\nFor each integer pair (i, j) with 1 \\leq i, j \\leq N, answer the following question:\n\n- Among all (not necessarily simple) paths from vertex i to vertex j whose concatenation of labels on the edges forms a palindrome, what is the length of the shortest such path? If there is no such path, the answer is -1.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\r\nC_{1, 1}C_{1, 2}\\ldotsC_{1, N}\r\nC_{2, 1}C_{2, 2}\\ldotsC_{2, N}\r\n\\vdots\r\nC_{N, 1}C_{N, 2}\\ldotsC_{N, N}\n\nOutput\n\nLet A_{i, j} be the answer to the question for the pair (i, j). Print them in the following format:\nA_{1, 1} A_{1, 2} \\ldots A_{1, N}\r\nA_{2, 1} A_{2, 2} \\ldots A_{2, N}\r\n\\vdots\r\nA_{N, 1} A_{N, 2} \\ldots A_{N, N}\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1 \\leq N \\leq 100\n- N is an integer.\n- Each C_{i, j} is either a lowercase English letter or -.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4\r\nab--\r\n--b-\r\n---a\r\nc---\n\nSample Output 1\n\n0 1 2 4\r\n-1 0 1 -1\r\n3 -1 0 1\r\n1 -1 -1 0\r\n\nFor example, consider the case (i, j) = (1, 4).\r\nBy taking the path 1 \\to 1 \\to 2 \\to 3 \\to 4, and concatenating the labels on its edges in order, we get the string abba, which is a palindrome.\r\nThere is no path of length at most 3 from vertex 1 to vertex 4 whose concatenation of labels is a palindrome. Thus, the answer for (1, 4) is 4.\nNote that the empty string is also a palindrome.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n5\r\nus---\r\n-st--\r\n--s--\r\nu--s-\r\n---ts\n\nSample Output 2\n\n0 1 3 -1 -1\r\n-1 0 1 -1 -1\r\n-1 -1 0 -1 -1\r\n1 3 -1 0 -1\r\n-1 -1 5 1 0",
