  "task_description": "You are given a positive integer n representing an n x n cargo deck on a ship. Each cell on the deck can hold one container with a weight of exactly w.\nHowever, the total weight of all containers, if loaded onto the deck, must not exceed the ship's maximum weight capacity, maxWeight.\nReturn the maximum number of containers that can be loaded onto the ship.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: n = 2, w = 3, maxWeight = 15\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: \nThe deck has 4 cells, and each container weighs 3. The total weight of loading all containers is 12, which does not exceed maxWeight.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: n = 3, w = 5, maxWeight = 20\nOutput: 4\nExplanation: \nThe deck has 9 cells, and each container weighs 5. The maximum number of containers that can be loaded without exceeding maxWeight is 4.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= n <= 1000\n1 <= w <= 1000\n1 <= maxWeight <= 10^9",
