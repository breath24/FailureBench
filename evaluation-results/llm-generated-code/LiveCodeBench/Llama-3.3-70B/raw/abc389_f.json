  "task_description": "Takahashi plans to participate in N AtCoder contests.\nIn the i-th contest (1 \\leq i \\leq N), if his rating is between L_i and R_i (inclusive), his rating increases by 1.\nYou are given Q queries in the following format:\n\n- An integer X is given. Assuming that Takahashi's initial rating is X, determine his rating after participating in all N contests.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN\r\nL_1 R_1\r\nL_2 R_2\r\n\\vdots\r\nL_N R_N\r\nQ\r\n\\text{query}_1\r\n\\text{query}_2\r\n\\vdots\r\n\\text{query}_Q\r\n\nHere, \\text{query}_i is the i-th query in the form:\nX\n\nOutput\n\nPrint Q lines.
