  "task_description": "You are given a grid of H rows and W columns.\r\nLet (i,j) denote the cell at row i (1 \\leq i \\leq H) from the top and column j (1 \\leq j \\leq W) from the left.\r\nThe state of the grid is represented by H strings S_1, S_2, \\ldots, S_H, each of length W, as follows:\n\n- If the j-th character of S_i is #, cell (i,j) is painted black.\n- If the j-th character of S_i is ., cell (i,j) is painted white.\n- If the j-th character of S_i is ?, cell (i,j) is not yet painted.\n\nTakahashi wants to paint each not-yet-painted cell white or black so that all the black cells form a rectangle.\r\nMore precisely, he wants there to exist a quadruple of integers (a,b,c,d) (1 \\leq a \\leq b \\leq H, 1 \\leq c \\leq d \\leq W) such that:\n\nFor each cell (i,j) (1 \\leq i \\leq H, 1 \\leq j \\leq W),\r\nif a \\leq i \\leq b and c \\leq j \\leq d, the cell is black;\r\notherwise, the cell is white.\n\nDetermine whether this is possible.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nH W\r\nS_1\r\nS_2\r\n\\vdots\r\nS_H\n\nOutput\n\nIf it is possible to paint all the not-yet-painted cells so that the black cells form a rectangle, print Yes; otherwise, print No.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1 \\leq H, W \\leq 1000\n- H and W are integers.\n- Each S_i is a string of length W consisting of #, ., ?.\n- There is at least one cell that is already painted black.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 5\r\n.#?#.\r\n.?#?.\r\n?...?\n\nSample Output 1\n\nYes\r\n\nThe grid is in the following state. ? indicates a cell that are not yet painted.\n\nBy painting cells (1,3), (2,2), and (2,4) black and cells (3,1) and (3,5) white, the black cells can form a rectangle as follows:\n\nTherefore, print Yes.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n3 3\r\n?##\r\n#.#\r\n##?\n\nSample Output 2\n\nNo\r\n\nTo form a rectangle with all black cells, you would need to paint cell (2,2) black, but it is already painted white.\r\nTherefore, it is impossible to make all black cells form a rectangle, so print No.\n\nSample Input 3\n\n1 1\r\n#\n\nSample Output 3\n\nYes",
