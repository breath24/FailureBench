  "task_description": "You are given integers W,H,L,R,D,U.\nA town of Kyoto is on the two-dimensional plane.\nIn the town, there is exactly one block at each lattice point (x,y) that satisfies all of the following conditions. There are no blocks at any other points.\n\n- 0\\leq x\\leq W\n- 0\\leq y\\leq H\n- x<L or R<x or y<D or U<y\n\nSnuke traveled through the town as follows.\n\n- First, he chooses one block and stands there.\n- Then, he performs the following operation any number of times (possibly zero):\n- Move one unit in the positive direction of the x-axis or the positive direction of the y-axis. However, the point after moving must also have a block.\n\n\n\nPrint the number, modulo 998244353, of possible paths that Snuke could have taken.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nW H L R D U\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the answer.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 0\\leq L\\leq R\\leq W\\leq 10^6\n- 0\\leq D\\leq U\\leq H\\leq 10^6\n- There is at least one block.\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4 3 1 2 2 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n192\r\n\nThe following are examples of possible paths. Here, a path is represented by listing the lattice points visited in order.\n\n- (3,0)\n- (0,0)\\rightarrow (1,0)\\rightarrow (2,0)\\rightarrow (2,1)\\rightarrow (3,1)\\rightarrow (3,2)\\rightarrow (4,2)\\rightarrow (4,3)\n- (0,1)\\rightarrow (0,2)\n\nThere are 192 possible paths.\n\nSample Input 2\n\n10 12 4 6 8 11\n\nSample Output 2\n\n4519189\n\nSample Input 3\n\n192 25 0 2 0 9\n\nSample Output 3\n\n675935675\r\n\nDo not forget to print the number of paths modulo 998244353.",
