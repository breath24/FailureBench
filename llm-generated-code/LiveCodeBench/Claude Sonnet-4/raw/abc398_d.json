  "task_description": "There is an infinitely large two-dimensional grid, with a campfire at coordinate (0,0).\nAt time t=0, smoke exists only at cell (0,0).\nYou are given a length-N string S consisting of N, W, S, E. At times t=1,2,\\dots,N, the following happen in order:\n\n- Wind blows, and all the smoke present at that time moves as follows:\n- If the t-th character of S is N, smoke in cell (r,c) moves to cell (r-1,c).\n- If it is W, smoke in cell (r,c) moves to cell (r,c-1).\n- If it is S, smoke in cell (r,c) moves to cell (r+1,c).\n- If it is E, smoke in cell (r,c) moves to cell (r,c+1).\n\n\n- If there is no smoke in cell (0,0), new smoke is generated at cell (0,0).\n\nTakahashi is standing at cell (R,C).\nFor each integer 1 \\le t \\le N, determine if smoke exists at cell (R,C) at time t+0.5, and print the response according to the required format.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN R C\nS\n\nOutput\n\nPrint an N-character string consisting of 0 and 1.\nThe t-th character (1 \\le t \\le N) should be:\n\n- 1 if smoke exists at cell (R,C) at time t+0.5, and\n- 0 otherwise.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- N is an integer between 1 and 200000, inclusive.\n- S is a length N string consisting of N, W, S, E.\n- R and C are integers between -N and N, inclusive.\n- (R,C) \\neq (0,0)\n\nSample Input 1\n\n6 -2 1\nNNEEWS\n\nSample Output 1\n\n001010\n\nAt times 1.5,2.5,4.5,6.5, there is no smoke at cell (-2,1). At times 3.5,5.5, there is smoke at cell (-2,1).\nHence, output 001010.\nIn the figures below, taking cell (0,0) with the campfire as a reference, cell (r,c) is drawn:\n\n- -r cells up if r < 0,\n- r cells down if r \\ge 0,\n- -c cells left if c < 0,\n- c cells right if c \\ge 0.\n\nThe grid at time 0.5 looks like:\n\nThe grid at time 1.5 looks like:\n\nThe grid at time 2.5 looks like:\n\nThe grid at time 3.5 looks like:\n\nThe grid at time 4.5 looks like:\n\nThe grid at time 5.5 looks like:\n\nThe grid at time 6.5 looks like:\n\nSample Input 2\n\n10 1 2\nNEESESWEES\n\nSample Output 2\n\n0001101011\n\nSample Input 3\n\n20 -1 -2\nWWNNWSWEWNSWWENSNWWN\n\nSample Output 3\n\n00100111111000101111",
