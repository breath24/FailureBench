  "task_description": "You are given a 2D array queries, where queries[i] is of the form [l, r]. Each queries[i] defines an array of integers nums consisting of elements ranging from l to r, both inclusive.\nIn one operation, you can:\n\nSelect two integers a and b from the array.\nReplace them with floor(a / 4) and floor(b / 4).\n\nYour task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce all elements of the array to zero for each query. Return the sum of the results for all queries.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: queries = [[1,2],[2,4]]\nOutput: 3\nExplanation:\nFor queries[0]:\n\nThe initial array is nums = [1, 2].\nIn the first operation, select nums[0] and nums[1]. The array becomes [0, 0].\nThe minimum number of operations required is 1.\n\nFor queries[1]:\n\nThe initial array is nums = [2, 3, 4].\nIn the first operation, select nums[0] and nums[2]. The array becomes [0, 3, 1].\nIn the second operation, select nums[1] and nums[2]. The array becomes [0, 0, 0].\nThe minimum number of operations required is 2.\n\nThe output is 1 + 2 = 3.\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: queries = [[2,6]]\nOutput: 4\nExplanation:\nFor queries[0]:\n\nThe initial array is nums = [2, 3, 4, 5, 6].\nIn the first operation, select nums[0] and nums[3]. The array becomes [0, 3, 4, 1, 6].\nIn the second operation, select nums[2] and nums[4]. The array becomes [0, 3, 1, 1, 1].\nIn the third operation, select nums[1] and nums[2]. The array becomes [0, 0, 0, 1, 1].\nIn the fourth operation, select nums[3] and nums[4]. The array becomes [0, 0, 0, 0, 0].\nThe minimum number of operations required is 4.\n\nThe output is 4.\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= queries.length <= 10^5\nqueries[i].length == 2\nqueries[i] == [l, r]\n1 <= l < r <= 10^9",
