  "task_description": "You are given a positive integer N between 1 and 10^9, inclusive.\nFind one pair of positive integers (A, M) satisfying the following conditions. It can be proved that such a pair of integers always exists under the constraints.\n\n- Both A and M are positive integers between 1 and 10^{18}, inclusive.\n- There exists a positive integer n such that A^n - 1 is a multiple of M, and the smallest such n is N.\n\nYou are given T test cases; solve each of them.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nT\n\\text{case}_1\n\\text{case}_2\n\\vdots\n\\text{case}_T\n\nHere, \\text{case}_i denotes the i-th test case.\nEach test case is given in the following format:\nN\n\nOutput\n\nFor each test case, print a pair of positive integers (A, M) in the following format:\nA M\n\nIf there are multiple valid solutions, any one of them is considered correct.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 1 \\le T \\le 10^4\n- 1 \\le N \\le 10^9\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n4\n3\n16\n1\n55\n\nSample Output 1\n\n2 7\n11 68\n20250126 1\n33 662\n\nConsider \\text{case}_1.\nFor example, if we choose (A,M)=(2,7), then:\n\n- When n=1: 2^1 - 1 = 1 is not a multiple of 7.\n- When n=2: 2^2 - 1 = 3 is not a multiple of 7.\n- When n=3: 2^3 - 1 = 7 is a multiple of 7.\n\nHence, the smallest n for which A^n - 1 is a multiple of M is 3. Therefore, (A,M)=(2,7) is a correct solution. Other valid solutions include (A,M)=(100,777).",
