  "task_description": "You are given a directed graph with N vertices and M edges. The vertices are numbered 1,2,\\dots,N. Edge j (j=1,2,\\dots,M) goes from vertex u_j to vertex v_j. It is guaranteed that vertex N is reachable from vertex 1.\nInitially, all edges have weight 0. We choose exactly K out of the M edges and change their weights to 1. Find the maximum possible value of the shortest distance from vertex 1 to vertex N in the resulting graph.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M K\r\nu_1 v_1\r\nu_2 v_2\r\n\\vdots\r\nu_M v_M\n\nOutput\n\nPrint the answer.\n\nConstraints\n\n\n- 2 \\leq N \\leq 30\n- 1 \\leq K \\leq M \\leq 100\n- 1 \\leq u_j, v_j \\leq N\n- u_j \\neq v_j\n- In the given graph, vertex N is reachable from vertex 1.\n- All input values are integers.\n\nSample Input 1\n\n3 3 2\r\n1 2\r\n2 3\r\n1 3\n\nSample Output 1\n\n1\r\n\nBy choosing edges 1,3, the shortest distance from vertex 1 to vertex 3 becomes 1.
