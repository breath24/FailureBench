  "task_description": "You are given an array of strings words and an integer k.\nFor each index i in the range [0, words.length - 1], find the length of the longest common prefix among any k strings (selected at distinct indices) from the remaining array after removing the i^th element.\nReturn an array answer, where answer[i] is the answer for i^th element. If removing the i^th element leaves the array with fewer than k strings, answer[i] is 0.\n \nExample 1:\n\nInput: words = [\"jump\",\"run\",\"run\",\"jump\",\"run\"], k = 2\nOutput: [3,4,4,3,4]\nExplanation:\n\nRemoving index 0 (\"jump\"):\n\n\t\nwords becomes: [\"run\", \"run\", \"jump\", \"run\"]. \"run\" occurs 3 times. Choosing any two gives the longest common prefix \"run\" (length 3).\n\n\nRemoving index 1 (\"run\"):\n\t\nwords becomes: [\"jump\", \"run\", \"jump\", \"run\"]. \"jump\" occurs twice. Choosing these two gives the longest common prefix \"jump\" (length 4).\n\n\nRemoving index 2 (\"run\"):\n\t\nwords becomes: [\"jump\", \"run\", \"jump\", \"run\"]. \"jump\" occurs twice. Choosing these two gives the longest common prefix \"jump\" (length 4).\n\n\nRemoving index 3 (\"jump\"):\n\t\nwords becomes: [\"jump\", \"run\", \"run\", \"run\"]. \"run\" occurs 3 times. Choosing any two gives the longest common prefix \"run\" (length 3).\n\n\nRemoving index 4 (\"run\"):\n\t\nwords becomes: [\"jump\", \"run\", \"run\", \"jump\"]. \"jump\" occurs twice. Choosing these two gives the longest common prefix \"jump\" (length 4).\n\n\n\n\nExample 2:\n\nInput: words = [\"dog\",\"racer\",\"car\"], k = 2\nOutput: [0,0,0]\nExplanation:\n\nRemoving any index results in an answer of 0.\n\n\n \nConstraints:\n\n1 <= k <= words.length <= 10^5\n1 <= words[i].length <= 10^4\nwords[i] consists of lowercase English letters.\nThe sum of words[i].length is smaller than or equal 10^5.",
