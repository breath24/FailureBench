  "task_description": "There is a sequence A = (A_1,\\dots,A_N). Determine whether there are at least two subsequences of A that match the sequence B = (B_1,\\dots,B_M). Two subsequences are distinguished if they are taken from different positions, even if they coincide as sequences.\n\nSubsequence\nA subsequence of A is a sequence obtained by removing zero or more elements from A and leaving the remaining elements in their original order.\n\nInput\n\nThe input is given from Standard Input in the following format:\nN M\nA_1 A_2 \\ldots A_N\nB_1 B_2 \\ldots B_M\n\nOutput\n\nIf there are at least two subsequences of A that match B, print Yes.
